# Faction Naming Policy — Belt Anti-Consensus Bloc

## Canonical Proper Name (LOCKED)
- **Asterion League**

Use **Asterion League** as the default reference in canon prose, metadata, timelines, faction docs, and continuity notes.

## Allowed Aliases (Context-Limited)
- **The League** (short-form, only when unambiguous in local context)
- **Asterion bloc** (strategic analysis shorthand)
- **Asterion Concord** (only for the League’s flagship technical wing/sub-organization; not a replacement for the parent faction name)

## Forbidden / Deprecated Terms
- **Belters** / **the Belters** as a generic stand-in for the faction
- **Belt Autonomist Fronts** as the primary proper name for this actor set
- Any unnamed generic label that replaces the proper faction identity

## In-Universe Slur Exception
Generic terms may appear **only** when explicitly presented as quoted in-universe language (e.g., hostile dialogue, propaganda excerpts, or diegetic documents), and should be clearly framed as voice, bias, or slur usage—not narrator canon labeling.

## Continuity Enforcement
When patching legacy references:
1. Replace generic faction stand-ins with **Asterion League**.
2. Preserve **Asterion Concord** only as a wing-level identifier.
3. Flag any new generic usage during continuity passes.
