## CP-001 — Book 1 Chronology Lock (CORE)

**Rule:** Book 1 order is locked as:
1) Command betrayal discovery + extraction kill-box + Blackfly escape, then
2) Subsequent free-team operations including Databank Raid / Ashes in the Box.

**Rationale:** preserves causality between institutional betrayal and later morally corrosive survival operations.

**Impacted docs:**
- `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md` (sequence clarification)
- `series/book-and-series-arc-scaffolds-v1.md` (arc skeleton ordering)
- `timeline/character-arc-turning-points-v1.md` (event labels remain compatible)

## CP-002 — Valerie Brother Thread Timing (CORE->SOFT interface lock)

**Rule:**
- **Book 1:** only weak/ambiguous signal seed credibility.
- **Book 2:** pre-reveal intervention and full reveal under mission countdown.

**Rationale:** prevents emotional-payoff inflation and preserves reveal plausibility runway.

**Impacted docs:**
- `series/book-and-series-arc-scaffolds-v1.md`
- `characters/core-squad-depth-pack-v1.md`
- `timeline/character-arc-turning-points-v1.md`
- `characters/valerie-brother-reveal-blueprint-v1.md`

## CP-003 — Escape Intervention Mechanism Constraint (SOFT lock)

**Rule:** Unknown-helper intervention at escape is only possible via:
1. pre-positioned exploit payloads,
2. narrow relay corridor windows,
3. delayed packet timing (not continuous omniscient control),
4. measurable self-risk for inside source.

**Rationale:** blocks deus-ex-machina repetition and aligns with latency-limited control doctrine.

**Impacted docs:**
- `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`
- `tech/technical-architecture-v1.md` (future explicit envelope pass)

---

## CP-004 — Evidence Chain Requirement for Information War (SOFT)

**Rule:** Any strategic proof release must include chain-of-custody metadata and at least one mirrored copy path prior to public deployment.

**Rationale:** keeps Book 3 proof war grounded against expected scrub/denial campaigns.

**Impacted docs:**
- `timeline/character-arc-turning-points-v1.md`
- future ops templates (scene packet header)

## Notes
- This patch set does not reveal unknown-helper identity.
- Helper identity remains controlled unknown for future plot leverage.
