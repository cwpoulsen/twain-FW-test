# Outer-System Governance Crisis Framework v1

Status: ACTIVE guidance canon expansion for Books 2-10 political scaffolding.

This document expands the governance crisis mechanics after the Blackfly opening AI acquisition, the later databank-training split, and the Class 4/3/2/1 fabrication order where Blackfly is constrained Class 2 and Asterion League is fragile Class 1. It focuses on mechanism -> decision -> cost, so that strategic drama is not reduced to slogans.


## 1. Cislunar Administrative Ring: crisis architecture

The Cislunar Administrative Ring becomes unstable when high visibility but saturated institutional surveillance intersects with delayed command loops and fragmented authority. Governance failure appears first as queue irregularity, then as selective law, then as legitimacy evaporation. Consensus Operations Complex can still optimize local throughput, but distance and data staleness produce governance overfit: decisions are perfectly tuned to yesterday's map.

Decision pressure: leaders must choose whether to centralize emergency powers or delegate adjudication to port-level crisis boards. Centralization improves doctrinal clarity yet worsens reaction time; delegation improves speed but increases policy drift and forum shopping. The Steward Directorate repeatedly chooses visible central decrees to preserve Earth-facing narrative control, while Belt actors choose pragmatic variance to keep people fed and systems running.

Cost propagation: each decree that ignores lane friction increases black-market dependence. Each local exception that bypasses treaty wording weakens coalition trust. Asterion League institutions can absorb some variance because fragile Class 1 capacity creates bargaining leverage, but they cannot absorb unlimited legitimacy loss. Blackfly's constrained Class 2 stack stabilizes specific nodes, not the whole ring. That bounded capability must remain explicit in scene planning.

Operational implications for scenes and arcs:

- Crisis beat 1: port stewards publish emergency ration priorities; opposition auditors challenge custody logs; convoy captains threaten refusal unless arbitration windows are shortened by one lane-cycle.

- Crisis beat 2: port stewards publish emergency ration priorities; opposition auditors challenge custody logs; convoy captains threaten refusal unless arbitration windows are shortened by one lane-cycle.

- Crisis beat 3: port stewards publish emergency ration priorities; opposition auditors challenge custody logs; convoy captains threaten refusal unless arbitration windows are shortened by one lane-cycle.

- Crisis beat 4: port stewards publish emergency ration priorities; opposition auditors challenge custody logs; convoy captains threaten refusal unless arbitration windows are shortened by one lane-cycle.

- Crisis beat 5: port stewards publish emergency ration priorities; opposition auditors challenge custody logs; convoy captains threaten refusal unless arbitration windows are shortened by one lane-cycle.

- Crisis beat 8: port stewards publish emergency ration priorities; opposition auditors challenge custody logs; convoy captains threaten refusal unless arbitration windows are shortened by one lane-cycle.

Strategic stake anchor: Steward Directorate legitimacy theater and queue discipline.

## 2. Inner Belt Municipal Ring: crisis architecture

The Inner Belt Municipal Ring becomes unstable when charter disputes and maintenance debt intersects with delayed command loops and fragmented authority. Governance failure appears first as queue irregularity, then as selective law, then as legitimacy evaporation. Consensus Operations Complex can still optimize local throughput, but distance and data staleness produce governance overfit: decisions are perfectly tuned to yesterday's map.

Decision pressure: leaders must choose whether to centralize emergency powers or delegate adjudication to port-level crisis boards.

## 3. Mid-Belt Transit Ring: crisis architecture

The Mid-Belt Transit Ring becomes unstable when convoy losses and insurance collapse intersects with delayed command loops and fragmented authority. Governance failure appears first as queue irregularity, then as selective law, then as legitimacy evaporation. Consensus Operations Complex can still optimize local throughput, but distance and data staleness produce governance overfit: decisions are perfectly tuned to yesterday's map.

Decision pressure: leaders must choose whether to centralize emergency powers or delegate adjudication to port-level crisis boards. Centralization improves doctrinal clarity yet worsens reaction time; delegation improves speed but increases policy drift and forum shopping.

## 4. Outer Belt Salvage Ring: crisis architecture

The Outer Belt Salvage Ring becomes unstable when FVB predation and emergency barter law intersects with delayed command loops and fragmented authority. Governance failure appears first as queue irregularity, then as selective law, then as legitimacy evaporation. Consensus Operations Complex can still optimize local throughput, but distance and data staleness produce governance overfit: decisions are perfectly tuned to yesterday's map.

Decision pressure: leaders must choose whether to centralize emergency powers or delegate adjudication to port-level crisis boards. Centralization improves doctrinal clarity yet worsens reaction time; delegation improves speed but increases policy drift and forum shopping. The Steward Directorate repeatedly chooses visible central decrees to preserve Earth-facing narrative control, while Belt actors choose pragmatic variance to keep people fed and systems running.

Cost propagation: each decree that ignores lane friction increases black-market dependence. Each local exception that bypasses treaty wording weakens coalition trust. Asterion League institutions can absorb some variance because fragile Class 1 capacity creates bargaining leverage, but they cannot absorb unlimited legitimacy loss. Blackfly's constrained Class 2 stack stabilizes specific nodes, not the whole ring. That bounded capability must remain explicit in scene planning.

## 5. Trojan Arbitration Ring: crisis architecture

The Trojan Arbitration Ring becomes unstable when proxy contracting and covert interdiction intersects with delayed command loops and fragmented authority. Governance failure appears first as queue irregularity, then as selective law, then as legitimacy evaporation.

Cost propagation: each decree that ignores lane friction increases black-market dependence. Each local exception that bypasses treaty wording weakens coalition trust. Asterion League institutions can absorb some variance because fragile Class 1 capacity creates bargaining leverage, but they cannot absorb unlimited legitimacy loss. Blackfly's constrained Class 2 stack stabilizes specific nodes, not the whole ring. That bounded capability must remain explicit in scene planning.
