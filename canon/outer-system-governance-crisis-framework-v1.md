# Outer-System Governance Crisis Framework v1

Status: ACTIVE guidance canon expansion for Books 2-10 political scaffolding.

This framework defines how governance crises propagate after the opening AI-seed extraction, the later databank training/provenance split, and the locked fabrication order (Class 4/3 -> Blackfly Class 2 -> Asterion League fragile Class 1).

## Core crisis model (mechanism -> decision -> cost)

1. **Mechanism:** lane latency, partial sensors, and maintenance debt break centralized certainty.
2. **Decision:** leaders choose between centralized command coherence and local delegation speed.
3. **Cost:** every shortcut creates legitimacy debt, black-market adaptation, and future convoy risk.

## Ring-specific failure surfaces

### 1) Cislunar Administrative Ring
- Trigger: surveillance-heavy queue governance plus stale command maps.
- Typical decision fork: preserve Earth-facing narrative control vs grant local exception authority.
- Cost signature: compliance theater rises while real throughput falls.
- Scene hooks:
  - Ration-priority decree contested by custody auditors.
  - Emergency power renewal hearing with contradictory sensor confidence reports.

### 2) Inner Belt Municipal Ring
- Trigger: charter disputes + deferred maintenance + legal fragmentation.
- Decision fork: standardized lawbook enforcement vs municipal variance to keep life-support stable.
- Cost signature: forum shopping, procurement favoritism, and trust collapse between ports.
- Scene hooks:
  - Spare-part allocation tribunal with missing telemetry chain.
  - Port labor refusal over fatigue ceilings and unpaid hazard schedules.

### 3) Mid-Belt Transit Ring
- Trigger: convoy attrition and insurance repricing spiral.
- Decision fork: hard convoy protection corridors vs diffuse escort coverage.
- Cost signature: uninsured routes feed smuggling and FVB recruitment funnels.
- Scene hooks:
  - Convoy corridor vote tied to Class 2 throughput rationing.
  - Escort commander forced to choose med cargo or reactor parts under burn limits.

### 4) Outer Belt Salvage Ring
- Trigger: barter-law improvisation under scarcity and predation pressure.
- Decision fork: strict treaty purity vs emergency salvage pragmatism.
- Cost signature: legitimacy fragments into local protection contracts.
- Scene hooks:
  - Salvage-right arbitration where both claims have partial custody proof.
  - Amnesty port pilot competing with coercive debt brokers.

### 5) Trojan Arbitration Ring
- Trigger: proxy contracting and covert interdiction in legally gray lanes.
- Decision fork: fast private enforcement vs slower public adjudication.
- Cost signature: legal text remains intact while coercive practice mutates underneath.
- Scene hooks:
  - Cross-jurisdiction panel deadlock over evidence admissibility windows.
  - Contract nullification crisis after delayed proof-of-spoof disclosure.

## Governance control clauses (non-negotiable)

1. Decisions expire after two transfer windows unless renewed with updated confidence and casualty/logistics accounting.
2. Emergency doctrine must include reversal criteria and public audit trail.
3. Major coercive actions require mirrored evidence publication path (not single-node custody).
4. Delegated authority must be time-scoped and attributable; no anonymous command laundering.

## Lock compliance checkpoints

- Uses **Asterion League** naming consistently.
- Preserves Blackfly as constrained **Class 2** and Asterion League as fragile **Class 1**.
- Preserves AI sequence lock: opening extraction acquires seed/system; databank raid is training/provenance.
- Preserves pursuit uncertainty: Blackfly remains missing asset under probabilistic dragnet.
- Preserves warform framing: full override is non-conscious remote operation.
