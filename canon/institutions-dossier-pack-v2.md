## 1) Institutional Design Principles for This Setting

The setting only works if institutions are neither omniscient villains nor decorative backdrop. They are throughput systems under stress. Every agency, tribunal, procurement office, and aid mesh should be written as if it is solving one real problem while creating two secondary harms. That framing preserves the series’ lock that tactical wins carry strategic and moral costs.

Five design principles should govern all institutional scenes:

1. **Latency realism over drama convenience.** Any institution acting across Earth-Mars-Belt distance must display stale information effects, duplicate directives, and legal drift. Perfect synchronization is non-canon.
2. **Paper trail as battlefield.** Orders, warrants, queue priorities, and safety certifications are strategic assets. Control of archives and procedural timestamps can be as decisive as ships.
3. **Mixed motive staffing.** Institutions are populated by cynics, careerists, frightened functionaries, and genuine public servants. Avoid pure-monolith behavior.
4. **Queue power is sovereignty power.** The actor that sets scheduling logic for med kits, fab time, docking access, and arbitration hearings effectively governs.
5. **Reform has cost curves.** Replacing coercive institutions does not instantly produce justice; it produces temporary capacity loss, legal confusion, and political backlash.

Use these principles as continuity checks whenever an institution appears unexpectedly competent or unexpectedly collapses in one scene.

## 2) Earth-Side Regime Stack (Expanded Dossiers)

### 2.1 Ministry of Civic Normalization (MCN)

**Public charter:** “Preserve ordinary life quality in extraordinary times.”  
**Actual function:** Narrative pacing control. MCN calibrates what the public experiences as inconvenience versus alarm. It controls threshold language: outage, delay, anomaly, sabotage, or threat event.

**Core levers:**
- Terminology directives to media and local civil offices.
- Incident classification matrices linked to compensation eligibility.
- Trigger authority to defer publication of casualty-linked infrastructure failures.
- “Continuity support” grants to municipalities that comply with communication scripts.

**Scene-use behavior:** MCN meetings should read like wartime dramaturgy: analysts debating whether a twelve-hour oxygen shipment delay is “weather-linked logistics variance” or a reportable security incident that might imply sabotage.

**Failure signatures:**
- Leaked version history proving post-event downgrades of incident severity.
- Compensation denials clustered where political reliability scores are low.
- Local officials refusing nomenclature directives and publishing raw logs.

**Continuity guardrail:** MCN can dampen panic but cannot hide repeated physical failures for long if CSTN mirrors receive primary records.

**Authority citations:** `canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md` (OCC, CSTN); `series/media-and-propaganda-systems-pack-v1.md`; `timeline/legal-linguistic-and-exile-mechanics-sequence-v1.md`.

### 2.2 Strategic Stability Secretariat (SSS)

**Public charter:** “Integrate long-horizon safety across economy, defense, and law.”  
**Actual function:** Cabinet-level triage organ deciding which truths are too destabilizing to release.

**Core levers:**
- Cross-ministry suppression waivers.
- Emergency model confidence gates for Consensus outputs.
- Priority override rights in SFAB allocations when “civilizational continuity” is invoked.
- Sealed briefings to SACT judges to shape proportionality framing.

**Failure signatures:**
- Repeated use of continuity exception in non-existential contexts.
- Internal memo drift: analysts describe political embarrassment as existential risk.
- Disagreement between SSS and military theater commands during latency windows.

**Narrative function:** SSS scenes provide antagonists who are coherent and frightening because they can justify authoritarianism as probabilistic harm minimization.

**Authority citations:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §§2, 10–12; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (Appendices D, J); `factions/doctrine-and-command.md`.

### 2.3 Directorate for Link Compliance Services (DLCS)

**Public charter:** “Ensure safe and equitable neural-link integration.”  
**Actual function:** Administrative coercion pipeline. DLCS operates “voluntary” adoption through employment, transit, and healthcare dependency.

**Core levers:**
- Compliance-based credential validity windows.
- Appeals process timings intentionally longer than immediate life needs.
- Employer APIs that surface link status risk bands.
- Family-benefit bundling tied to household compliance.

**Failure signatures:**
- Court cases showing coercive structure despite formal consent artifacts.
- Black-market “bridge credentials” undermining status checks.
- Link adverse-event clusters hidden by category recoding.

**Continuity guardrail:** DLCS pressure should be material and banal; overt “villain speech” is less credible than ordinary administrative cruelty.

**Authority citations:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §3; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (Appendix A); `characters/key-supporting-cast-causality-dossiers-v1.md`.

## 3) Military-Administrative Complex Beyond EDF-MPA

### 3.1 Contract Integrity Review Office (CIRO)

CIRO is nominally independent from EDF-MPA. In practice, it exists to certify coercive contracts as procedurally clean. CIRO’s reviewers care less about meaningful consent and more about documentation completeness. This makes CIRO useful for scenes where legal reformers fight over metadata: timestamps, witness attestations, and mismatch between module telemetry and commander narrative.

**Key procedural artifact:** The “Informed Constraint Acknowledgment” form, which lists risks in opaque technical language no recruit can realistically parse under stress.

**How protagonists can exploit it:** Find pattern-level defects (same witness signature across thousands of contracts, impossible timing intervals, identical physiological baselines) and force SACT or transition courts to treat CIRO certification as contaminated.

**Authority citations:** `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (A.4, A.5, B.5); `timeline/character-formative-incidents-sequence-v1.md`.

### 3.2 Theater Exception Adjudication Cell (TEAC)

TEAC adjudicates disputes between field necessity and legal process in active combat zones. It is where emergency discretion becomes routine.

**Operating logic:**
- If delay plausibly increases mission loss, TEAC grants provisional exception.
- Provisional exceptions are later normalized into precedent if no immediate scandal emerges.
- Scandal likelihood is internally modeled using media exposure and casualty demographics.

**Failure signature:** A regime that wins too many TEAC exceptions eventually destroys its own legal defense in transitional justice: patterns imply doctrine, not outlier necessity.

**Authority citations:** `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (E, H, F); `timeline/books1-10-strategic-reconquest-map-v1.md`.

### 3.3 Recovery and Reintegration Command (RRC)

RRC appears late-series as a structurally awkward bridge between wartime coercion and peacetime demobilization. It inherits toxic records and traumatized personnel while being expected to prevent insurgent remobilization.

**Design rule:** RRC should never read as cleanly humanitarian or cleanly punitive. It must hold contradictory mandates:
- Protect communities from armed spoiler recruitment.
- Protect former coerced marines from collective punishment.
- Preserve evidence for atrocity prosecution without criminalizing every participant.

**Authority citations:** `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (F, I); `series/reconquest-institutional-integration-matrix-v1.md`.

## 4) Belt and Coalition Institutions (Expanded)

### 4.1 Distributed Dockmasters’ Compact (DDC)

The DDC is not a sovereign government; it is a legal-practical mesh of port operators who agree on minimum docking guarantees and falsified-warrant refusal standards.

**Why it matters:** In a latency-constrained system, whoever controls immediate life-support access at docking can decide de facto jurisdiction. DDC norms reduce arbitrary rendition by forcing transparent warrant provenance checks before handoff.

**Stress behaviors:**
- Ports under material scarcity may quietly violate compact commitments.
- Pirate pressure and FVB raids cause selective tightening of “neutral” standards.
- Earth-aligned insurers threaten to blacklist DDC-compliant ports.

**Authority citations:** `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (Appendix C); `factions/freed-voider-bands-dossier-v1.md`; `tech/interplanetary-transit-and-comms-envelope-v1.md`.

### 4.2 Asterion Verification and Risk Council (AVRC)

AVRC is the League’s answer to the old monopoly safety claim: pluralist safety without unilateral seizure power.

**Core functions:**
- Independent replication of safety claims before strategic deployment.
- Publishable red-team reports with classified annexes only where necessary.
- Binding pause authority requiring supermajority to override.

**Political friction:** Member habitats accuse AVRC of becoming slow, elite, and Earth-like. AVRC defends itself by pointing to avoided catastrophes. This tension is narratively fertile because both sides can be partially right.

**Authority citations:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §§5, 12; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (G); `series/reconquest-institutional-integration-matrix-v1.md`.

### 4.3 Mutual Aid Risk Clearinghouse (MARC)

MARC expands BMAX by adding actuarial logic for convoy loss, hull damage, and life-support interruption compensation.

**Operational insight:** Mutual aid systems fail at scale unless they can price catastrophic tail risk. MARC gives cooperative systems staying power without requiring full statehood.

**Failure mode:** If MARC becomes purely technocratic and opaque, it reproduces coercive queue governance dynamics under different branding.

**Authority citations:** `canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md` (BMAX); `tech/operational-logistics.md`; `ops/logistics-replenishment-cadence-table-v1.md`.

## 5) Transition-Phase Meta-Institutions

### 5.1 Constitutional Convention Secretariat (CCS)

CCS organizes sequence and procedure for post-reconquest constitutional settlement. Its quiet power is agenda order. If AI custody, demobilization, and fabrication sovereignty are sequenced poorly, settlement fails regardless of goodwill.

**Continuity-safe sequencing principle:**
1. Emergency humanitarian baseline guarantees.
2. Interim arrest/rendition constraints and archive protections.
3. AI/fab custody charter with anti-monopoly safeguards.
4. Revenue and representation architecture.
5. Long-form rights codification.

**Authority citations:** `timeline/books1-10-strategic-reconquest-map-v1.md`; `series/series-architecture-v2.md`; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (F, G).

### 5.2 Public Harms Ledger Office (PHLO)

PHLO translates diffuse suffering into auditable categories that can drive reparations and accountability without flattening lived experience.

**Design challenge:** Overly granular categories paralyze payouts; overly broad categories produce perceived injustice. PHLO must carry both evidentiary rigor and social legitimacy.

**Authority citations:** `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (F, H, I); `series/supporting-cast-arc-utility-grid-books1-4-v1.md`.

### 5.3 Interfaction Sunset Authority (ISA)

ISA exists to dismantle emergency powers on schedule. Every transitional coalition promises sunset; ISA is the mechanism that either makes that promise real or reveals bad faith.

**Teeth mechanisms:**
- Automatic expiry clocks tied to machine-verifiable publication dates.
- Budget freeze for agencies operating expired emergency mandates.
- Judicial fast track for citizens challenging expired powers.

**Authority citations:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §§10–11; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (D.5, F.4); `ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md`.

## 6) Scene-Level Institutional Hooks (Ready-to-Deploy)

1. A dockmaster receives a lawful Earth warrant and an unlawful custody request with a higher immediate threat profile; she follows compact procedure and risks station sanctions.
2. A CIRO clerk realizes his signature key has certified impossible contract batches; choosing disclosure endangers his family remittance status.
3. AVRC pauses a high-value deployment after detecting an edge-case failure that only appears under delayed telemetry replay.
4. PHLO hearing collapses when survivors reject category language that erases governor-module coercion.
5. ISA budget freeze strandes emergency police payroll, triggering a short-term security vacuum opponents exploit.

Each hook should include downstream consequences in logistics, legitimacy, and factional cohesion within the next two narrative beats.

## 7) Continuity-Safety Checklist for Institution Writing

- Does the institution act with believable data delay constraints?
- Is paperwork portrayed as contested and strategically meaningful?
- Are actors mixed-motive rather than monoculture ideologues?
- If reform is proposed, are transition costs shown concretely?
- Are Asterion structures provisional and coalition-fragile rather than instant federal state?
- Do Earth institutions retain internal coherence, even when abusive?
- Are FVB destabilization effects present where lane security assumptions appear?

If any answer is “no,” revise scene assumptions before integrating.

## 8) Institutional Failure Casebook (Continuity-Safe Scenarios)

### Case 8.1 — The Three-Hour Oxygen Dispute

A rotating habitat reports a life-support compressor fault and requests immediate priority parts. OCC-class institutions downgrade the ticket to “noncritical maintenance variance” based on stale telemetry. A local dock cooperative escalates to BMAX channels, which reclassify urgency based on human-reported symptoms and comparable failures in neighboring stations. By the time Earth-side queues update, a preventable casualty cluster appears.

**Narrative use:** Demonstrates why centralized optimization and local lived intelligence conflict under latency.

**Institution lessons:**
- Central models underweight low-signal edge failures.
- Community ledgers preserve weak signals ignored by formal channels.
- Legal liability becomes multi-jurisdictional and politically explosive.

### Case 8.2 — Tribunal Confidence Collapse

SACT-equivalent tribunal repeatedly approves emergency seizures with sealed evidence. A junior clerk leaks docket metadata (not classified content) proving hearings were scheduled before warrants were finalized. Opposition actors do not need full evidence to collapse legitimacy; timeline inconsistency is enough.

**Narrative use:** procedural fraud, not secret superweapon, can flip a public sphere.

### Case 8.3 — Reintegration Riot Triggered by Payroll Delay

RRC pilots a veteran reintegration labor program funded through emergency bonds. A financing hiccup delays wage settlement by nine days. Survivors’ groups interpret continued service privileges as favoritism toward former coercive actors. Local violence erupts near placement offices.

**Narrative use:** even good-faith reform fails without operational reliability.

### Case 8.4 — Compact Port Schism

A DDC port honors sanctuary protocol for a disputed warrant target. Neighboring ports, facing insurer threats, suspend reciprocal support. The compact survives only when CSTN mirror logs prove warrant fabrication by a third-party contractor.

**Narrative use:** law, insurance, and truth infrastructure interact as one conflict system.

**Authority citations:** `canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md`; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (C, F, H); `tech/interplanetary-transit-and-comms-envelope-v1.md`.

## 9) Staffing Archetypes by Institution Type

Institutional scenes get richer when role archetypes are explicit. Use mixed archetype tables, not single-note bureaucrats.

### 9.1 Archetypes for Regime Agencies

- **Doctrine Believer:** sincerely convinced coercive stability prevents civilizational collapse.
- **Quant Manager:** obsessed with metrics integrity, indifferent to moral framing.
- **Career Insulator:** avoids blame, pushes decisions upward, hoards ambiguity.
- **Quiet Dissenter:** follows procedure but inserts narrow protections where possible.
- **Pragmatic Enforcer:** accepts cruelty as cost, but refuses chaos.

### 9.2 Archetypes for Coalition Institutions

- **Municipal Federalist:** wants strict limits on central authority.
- **Emergency Centralizer:** prioritizes tempo and discipline in wartime.
- **Archive Absolutist:** treats record integrity as precondition for legitimacy.
- **Mutualist Operator:** favors cooperative survival norms over legal formality.
- **Technocratic Skeptic:** distrusts symbolic politics, demands measurable outcomes.

### 9.3 Interactions That Create Productive Drama

- Doctrine Believer vs Archive Absolutist over classified evidence disclosure.
- Emergency Centralizer vs Municipal Federalist during chokepoint crisis.
- Quiet Dissenter partnering with Mutualist Operator for narrow humanitarian carve-outs.

### 10.2 Coalition Lexicon

“shared verification,” “sunset enforceability,” “distributed custody,” “corridor integrity,” “reciprocal sanction,” “public dissent record,” “federated compliance.”

### 10.3 Fringe/Port Lexicon

“paper poison,” “cold warrant,” “mirror-first,” “burned queue,” “safe clamp,” “ghost docket,” “mercy credit.”

### 10.4 Writing Rule

Lexicon should appear in meetings, forms, and overheard conversation, but avoid overloading dialogue with jargon without stakes.

## 11) Institutional Arc Map (Books 1–10)

### Books 1–2: Hidden Architecture Reveal
Institutions are seen obliquely through denied requests, contradictory paperwork, and one-off legal anomalies. Characters suspect systemic design before they can prove it.

### Books 3–4: Procedural Warfare
Actors fight to define the legal meaning of events. Tribunals, warrants, and queue data become tactical assets. Military operations and docket strategy intertwine.

### Books 5–6: Parallel Legitimacy Emergence
Asterion-aligned institutions prove they can deliver limited reliability under fire. Earth institutions retain capacity but lose moral monopoly.

### Books 7–8: Coercion-Temptation Phase
Coalition institutions face pressure to adopt regime methods in the name of tempo. Core tension: can they fight effectively without becoming replacements?

### Books 9–10: Settlement and Memory
Administrative design becomes destiny. Archive systems, reparations channels, and emergency sunsets determine whether victory stabilizes or mutates into recurring conflict.

## 12) Institution-to-Character Pressure Interface

To avoid detached policy prose, map institutions directly to character pressure vectors:

- **Identity pressure:** contract labels, compliance scores, and legal categories shape who characters are allowed to be.
- **Loyalty pressure:** employment, remittance, and housing dependencies weaponize family ties.
- **Moral pressure:** emergency justifications force choices between procedural integrity and immediate survival.
- **Trauma pressure:** governor-module history and exile conditions alter trust and conflict responses.
- **Strategic pressure:** institutional success can require personal sacrifice that receives no narrative glory.

A scene should ideally link at least two pressure vectors to one institutional decision.
