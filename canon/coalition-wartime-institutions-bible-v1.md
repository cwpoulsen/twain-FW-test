# Coalition Wartime Institutions Bible v1

Status: reconciled continuity pass (Wave 11).

## Mandate Stack and Wartime Legitimacy
Coalition wartime institutions in this setting only work if they are built on double accountability: survival outcomes in delayed theaters, and legitimacy signals that survive adversarial audits. They cannot out-centralize the Steward Directorate/Consensus Operations Complex on throughput, so they compete on procedural clarity and reversible decisions under latency.

## Emergency Deliberation Cells
Emergency Deliberation Cells (EDCs) are bounded trustees for delayed theaters: time-limited authority, confidence-banded decisions, mandatory reopen triggers, and randomized retrospective audits. Every emergency order includes expiration, harm forecast, and review owner.

## Coalition Custody and Prisoner Architecture
Custody is distributed (short-duration transfer nodes), with split ledgers for security and rights assurance. Canon lock preserved: non-conscious warforms are not legal persons; accountability flows to human/institutional command chains.

## Wartime Finance Office and Scarcity Truthfulness
The Wartime Finance Office publishes scarcity-real ledgers, discrepancy reports, and reserve-release criteria. Finance must track actual logistics constraints, not political comfort pricing.

## Civilian Continuity Ministry in Exile
CCME preserves schooling/care/identity continuity with latency-aware rights clocks, refugee ombud channels, and portable records (crypto + analog mirrors).

## Inter-Theater Constitutional Safeguards (Reconciled)
- Three-ring governance: execution, harmonization, audit.
- Mandatory minimum-viable degraded-mode procedure for each rule.
- Functional separation: allocation, review, and narrative offices cannot be fused.
- Public error correction with deadlines.

## Supplement Modules (Reconciled, de-duplicated)
### Wartime Ombud Federation
Independent complaint intake, public findings, and auto-review triggers tied to abuse thresholds.

### Coalition Procurement Integrity Regime
Dual-signature procurement changes, anti-capture rotations, and conflict-of-interest disclosure bundles.

### Demobilization Pre-Commitments During Active War
Pre-signed veteran transition guarantees, labor protections, and monitored drawdown triggers to prevent postwar betrayal shocks.

### Institutional Interoperability with Asterion League
Checksumed legal/data interfaces, dissent-map attachments, and limited mutual-recognition pathways that avoid sovereignty collapse.

### Institutional Failure Drills and Red-Team Governance
Quarterly adversarial drills against corruption, spoofed evidence, and panic-law overreach with published corrective actions.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- No Earth real-time command assumptions.
- No Consensus Class 1 monopoly claims.
- Blackfly remains constrained Class 2.
- Freed Voider Bands remain mixed-actor destabilizer ecology.
- Warform accountability remains human-command anchored.
