# Coalition Wartime Institutions Bible v1

Status: Expansion pass for institutional depth under canon lock.

## Mandate Stack and Wartime Legitimacy
Coalition wartime institutions in this setting only work if they are built on a double-accountability doctrine: first to survival outcomes in delayed, fragmented theater conditions; second to legitimacy signals that can survive hostile propaganda review and postwar audits. The coalition cannot out-centralize Consensus in raw throughput, so it must outcompete on explainability, portability, and procedural fairness under latency. Every authority body is therefore designed as a mobile institution: charter text, voting rights, emergency powers, and revocation criteria are packaged so they can be instantiated in convoy, station, or temporary dockyard governance nodes without waiting for Earth-adjacent legal infrastructure.

The governing premise is that wartime institutions should never rely on perfect information. They should assume stale telemetry, compromised witnesses, and contradictory records. Instead of pretending certainty, each institution defines confidence bands and reversible decisions. A command decision can be binding for six hours in one lane segment and automatically reopen after cross-lane corroboration arrives. This avoids two catastrophic failure modes: paralysis from waiting for perfect data and tyranny from pretending stale data is enough for permanent judgment.

Legitimacy comes from disclosed constraints. Coalition councils publish what they cannot see, what they cannot enforce, and what tradeoffs they made. This is politically expensive in the short term but strategically superior over a long campaign because it hardens trust among operators, refugees, and neutral guild actors who know hidden absolutism is usually the prelude to exploitation. Institutions thus become resilient not by force concentration but by expectation management and procedural consistency.

To avoid mimicry of Steward governance theater, coalition charters separate narrative authority from coercive authority. Spokes councils can communicate and persuade, but they cannot unilaterally detain, seize, or sentence. Coercive actions require adjudication records and cross-signature from at least one civilian-protection office. This design is slower than martial law templates, but it preserves the coalition's stated strategic objective: replacing a coercive stability machine with a federated sovereignty model that tolerates plural local cultures while maintaining shared anti-predation rules.

## Emergency Deliberation Cells
Emergency Deliberation Cells (EDCs) are the coalition's substitute for impossible real-time plenary governance. Each cell is a three-to-seven-member rotating panel trained to decide under comms delay and partial intelligence. EDCs are not mini dictatorships; they are bounded trustees with strict sunset mechanisms. Every emergency decision must carry an expiration timestamp, evidence confidence rating, expected externalities list, and mandatory review trigger.

Cell composition is intentionally cross-functional: one operations lead, one logistics accounting officer, one civilian impact recorder, and optional legal and medical observers depending on mission profile. This structure forces operational urgency to coexist with human consequence accounting. The civilian recorder is not ceremonial; without a civilian impact log entry, emergency force authorization packets are treated as incomplete and cannot be propagated as precedent.

EDCs are deployed in layered topology. Frontline cells can authorize immediate route closures, boarding quarantines, or temporary labor requisition caps. Mid-lane cells can ratify or revoke those decisions once broader telemetry arrives. Theater cells reconcile conflicts between lane authorities and publish harmonization bulletins. This allows a decision to exist when needed without pretending that first-contact decisions are globally optimal.

Abuse prevention relies on randomized retrospective audit. Any EDC action can be pulled into post-action review by audit draw, casualty threshold, or complaint quorum from affected crews and settlements. Audits examine whether the cell used allowed evidence classes, whether alternatives were considered, and whether the chosen action proportionally matched risk. Repeated overreach strips cell members of future emergency authority and can trigger reparative compensation obligations charged against coalition logistics credits.

## Coalition Custody and Prisoner Architecture
Coalition custody doctrine in contested lanes rejects mass detention infrastructure because static prison systems become sabotage magnets and political corruption hubs. Instead, custody is distributed into short-duration transfer nodes with continuous review and identity provenance checks. The design objective is to maintain humane treatment and evidentiary integrity while preventing disappearance practices associated with Consensus black-site mythology.

Custody begins with capture classification: combatant under active engagement, contracted predation actor, coerced auxiliary, non-combatant attached to hostile vessel, or identity-uncertain person. Classification determines transport priority, restraint profile, interview timing, and access to representation channels. Critically, classification is provisional and must be updated as corroboration arrives.

A key continuity-safe feature is distinction between conscious agency actors and remote-instrument warform units. Coalition rules bar anthropomorphic sentencing language for fully overridden non-conscious warforms. Legal accountability follows commanding human or institutional chains, not the shell unit. This prevents ethical drift and aligns with locked canon constraints on warform agency portrayal.

Custody nodes maintain split ledgers: operational security ledger and rights assurance ledger. The security ledger tracks risk variables, movement permissions, and chain-of-custody for seized materials. The rights ledger tracks nutrition, medical care, sleep window, translator access, and challenge petitions. Tampering with either ledger triggers immediate transfer to neutral review board if available, or provisional sanctions against responsible officers until review.

The coalition treats prolonged detention as institutional failure except for narrow high-risk classes. The preferred pathway is accelerated adjudication, supervised release, exchange, or labor-restoration compact where victims are compensated. This shifts resources from incarceration overhead toward lane stabilization and restitution.

## Wartime Finance Office and Scarcity Truthfulness
The Wartime Finance Office (WFO) governs coalition credit issuance, requisition pricing, and emergency debt conversion under hard logistics limits. Its central principle is scarcity truthfulness: prices and allocations must communicate real throughput constraints, not political comfort. If coolant is short, the ledger must show scarcity in actionable form so captains and settlement councils can adapt behavior before crisis cascades.

WFO credits are redeemable across coalition-certified depots but carry context tags indicating source theater, contamination risk, and expiration risk bands. Credits from extreme-risk seizure operations may devalue faster unless backed by audited cargo manifests. This discourages speculative predation masquerading as wartime procurement and keeps finance linked to verifiable logistics.

Emergency debt conversion allows civilian operators forced into coalition support to convert unpaid requisitions into long-duration service credits, tax offsets, or lane-priority guarantees. The conversion menu is negotiated by sector councils and published in plain language to reduce manipulation by contract intermediaries. Black-market arbitrage pressure remains, but transparent conversion options reduce desperation deals.

The WFO also runs antifragility reserves: small distributed stockpiles of critical consumables intentionally placed in unglamorous nodes unlikely to be first-wave targets. Reserve disclosure is partial; public doctrine confirms existence and governance but not exact locations. Release authority requires dual signoff from logistics and civilian continuity officers.

Because propaganda attacks focus on corruption narratives, WFO publishes monthly discrepancy reports: unexplained losses, investigation status, recovered value, and sanctions. The coalition accepts short-term embarrassment to sustain long-term credibility, a strategic inversion of Consensus opacity habits.

## Civilian Continuity Ministry in Exile
The Civilian Continuity Ministry in Exile (CCME) is the institution that keeps coalition war efforts from collapsing into purely military priorities. CCME tracks schooling continuity, care provision, identity records, and labor protection across moving populations. It exists because refugee governance under latency fails when treated as side administration.

CCME operates with modular governance kits: identity verification templates, ration fairness algorithms with manual override paths, childcare cooperative charters, elder-care prioritization protocols, and trauma rotation schedules for overburdened med staff. These kits are adapted locally but preserve common data schemas so settlements can interoperate without surrendering local autonomy.

A core CCME innovation is latency-aware rights clocks. Rights are not paused because confirmation is delayed. If a person files a shelter denial challenge, the clock starts at filing node time, and interim protections apply until final review. This prevents bureaucratic voids where people are effectively unprotected because records are in transit.

CCME also certifies community ombud circles drawn from refugees themselves. Ombuds can issue non-binding but publicly logged findings on abuse, discrimination, and ration manipulation. While they lack direct coercive power, their findings trigger automatic review obligations for formal authorities. This gives displaced populations voice without requiring immediate full electoral integration.

Institutional durability depends on portable records security. CCME uses layered cryptographic signing plus low-tech analog mirrors for critical registries. When digital systems are jammed or compromised, analog packets maintain continuity of family links, medical dependencies, and legal claims.

## Inter-Theater Constitutional Safeguards

Inter-Theater Constitutional Safeguards is treated as a first-order operational requirement rather than decorative policy text. Doctrine assumes adversaries exploit ambiguity, delay, and administrative fatigue. Therefore each procedure explicitly states decision owner, evidence floor, reversible pathway, and accountability trigger.

Implementation model uses three rings: frontline execution ring, supervisory harmonization ring, and retrospective audit ring. The frontline ring acts with bounded authority to prevent immediate harm. The supervisory ring resolves cross-node inconsistency and redistributes workload when a node is saturated. The audit ring tests proportionality, bias drift, and unintended system effects, publishing corrective notices even when politically inconvenient.

Resource realism is mandatory. Every rule includes a minimal viable form for degraded environments: power loss, relay interruption, medical overflow, or staff shortage. If doctrine only works under ideal staffing, it is marked aspirational and cannot be used to justify sanctions. This keeps institutions aligned with reality-gate constraints and avoids performative legality.

Governance durability depends on social intelligibility. Procedures are translated into plain-language cards carried by crews, med teams, and refugee councils. Cards list rights, deadlines, interim protections, and appeal routes. In literacy-constrained or multilingual zones, visual icon standards and audio prompts are distributed so legal access does not depend on elite education.

Data governance follows minimization and compartmentalization. Authorities collect what is necessary for safety and adjudication, no more. Sensitive identity data is role-gated and expires unless retention is justified by active case requirements. Breach events trigger mandatory notification and temporary evidentiary caution on affected records.

Conflict de-escalation is embedded at each stage. Before coercive escalation, officers must log at least one lower-intensity alternative considered and reason for rejection. This requirement creates auditable friction against fear-driven overreach and reinforces coalition narrative distinction from Consensus coercive defaults.

To resist corruption, doctrine separates allocation power from review power and from narrative power. The office that grants route priority cannot unilaterally close related complaints; the office that communicates public outcomes cannot suppress dissent annotations in formal records. Functional separation is expensive but crucial in chronic emergency ecosystems.

Training cadence uses scenario libraries drawn from real incidents: forged manifests, manipulated sensor frames, coercive labor contracts, sabotage hidden inside maintenance delays, and retaliatory rumor campaigns. Teams rehearse not just technical response but legitimacy preservation under public scrutiny. After-action reviews require explicit mapping from action to canon constraints and logistics realities.

Metrics focus on behavior change rather than headline seizures or conviction counts. Core indicators include time-to-interim-protection, reversal rate by evidence band, compensation completion rate, reduction in repeat harm along treated corridors, and trust survey stability among displaced communities. Metrics are stratified by location class so high-burden nodes are compared fairly.

Failure handling favors transparent correction over denial. When doctrine fails, institutions publish causal hypotheses, interim mitigations, and revision deadlines. This approach accepts short-term reputational pain to build long-term credibility and reduces disinformation leverage by hostile factions who rely on secrecy gaps.
