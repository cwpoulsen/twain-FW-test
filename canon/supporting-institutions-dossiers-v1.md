## Purpose

This dossier defines the major supporting institutions that make the setting function at scale without violating locked constraints:
- AI seed box remains catalyst, not instant superweapon.
- Asterion League naming and strategic role are preserved.
- Class 1 / Class 2 fabrication path remains a sovereignty problem, not a magic production curve.
- Ten-book reconquest arc remains gradual and institution-heavy.
- Fusion/transit constraints remain binding on strategy, law, and logistics.

Each institution entry includes:
1. Charter claim (public narrative)
2. Practical mandate (what it really does)
3. Levers of control
4. Failure modes
5. Book-phase relevance

## I-01. Office of Civic Continuity (OCC)

### Charter Claim
The OCC protects uninterrupted civil services across Earth and orbital habitats, ensuring life-support fairness and queue transparency.

### Practical Mandate
The OCC is the regime’s narrative shock absorber. It does not merely maintain services; it curates what citizens perceive as “normal breakage” versus “security event.” It converts strategic sabotage, transit delay, and policy punishment into apparently administrative causes.

### Levers of Control
- Queue recategorization authority for food, med allotments, and fabrication slots.
- Emergency continuity declarations that bypass local councils while retaining legal theater.
- Metrics dashboards fed into Consensus priority engines.
- Credential throttling for technical staff mobility.

### Failure Modes
- Overuse of queue exceptions reveals political hand and collapses legitimacy.
- Data tampering chains become discoverable when independent verification nodes arise in Belt communities.
- Latency between Earth command and outer systems creates contradictory queue directives.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 1-3: background coercion mechanism behind “accidental” shortages.
- Books 4-6: fracture point as OCC paperwork no longer matches physical throughput reality.
- Books 7-10: either reformed into auditable civil service mesh or dissolved as a coercive relic.

---

## I-02. Steward Audit and Compliance Tribunal (SACT)

### Charter Claim
A quasi-judicial body that ensures emergency powers are legally proportionate and reviewed.

### Practical Mandate
SACT launders pre-selected outcomes into procedural legitimacy. It is where emergency actions gain post hoc legal polish. Its judges are less independent arbiters than risk managers balancing elite consensus, public optics, and data visibility.

### Levers of Control
- Case sequencing: urgent civil liberty appeals can be delayed while security seizures are fast-tracked.
- Classified evidence channels immune to ordinary disclosure.
- Closed-docket doctrine for “algorithmic integrity” cases.
- Sanction authority over regional magistrates who deviate.

### Failure Modes
- Whistleblowers exposing discrepancy between internal risk scores and public rulings.
- Document leaks proving scripted decision trees across multiple judges.
- Coalition-era transitional prosecutors re-opening legacy rulings.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 2-4: provides legal scaffolding for treating Blackfly crew as non-person threats while operating under uncertainty (asset missing, current location unknown).
- Books 5-8: becomes battleground over custody law for AI seed and Class 1 evidence.
- Books 9-10: central constitutional question—abolish, sunset, or repurpose with radical transparency.

## I-03. Earth Defense Force Marine Procurement Authority (EDF-MPA)

### Charter Claim
Ensures mission-ready marine capacity through fair recruitment and contract administration.

### Practical Mandate
Maintains the coercive contract trap pipeline for excluded/unlinked populations while preserving deniability. The EDF-MPA’s bureaucratic layer hides lethal compliance mechanisms behind language of “mission integrity tooling.”

### Levers of Control
- Contract architecture binding recruits to governor-module constraints.
- Benefit structures conditional on compliance telemetry.
- Family remittance locks tied to service completion metrics.
- Refusal breach automation via internal enforcement flags.

### Failure Modes
- Public release of contract language proving coercion.
- Operational losses high enough that remittance defaults expose exploitative design.
- Belt sanctuary jurisdictions refusing extradition of “deserters.”

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 1-2: origin trauma pressure for core squad trajectories (pre-Blackfly EDF history, not ongoing identity).
- Books 3-6: evidence vector for anti-regime coalition recruitment.
- Books 7-10: demobilization problem; veterans need lawful reintegration without resurrecting coercive doctrine.

---

## I-04. Strategic Fabrication Allocation Board (SFAB)

### Charter Claim
Allocates Class 2 and higher fabrication resources to maximize species-level resilience.

### Practical Mandate
The SFAB is the bottleneck throne. By controlling high-value fabrication queues, it decides who gets medical miracles, compute infrastructure, and military edge. It is not only industrial policy; it is sovereignty by scheduling.

### Levers of Control
- Priority algorithms weighted by political reliability scores.
- Classified “catastrophe reserve” pools for elite contingencies.
- Interdict authority over suspicious feedstock movement.
- Certification blacklists for noncompliant fab technicians.

### Failure Modes
- Asterion League creates external benchmark proving SFAB scarcity claims are partly manufactured.
- Throughput audits reveal intentional underutilization to preserve political dependence.
- Sabotage of verification chains causes confidence collapse in SFAB outputs.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 2-4: explains why control of evidence and fab staff matters as much as ships.
- Books 5-7: main arena of Class 1/Class 2 parity war.
- Books 8-10: redesign toward federated allocation compact to avoid monopoly relapse.

## I-05. Interplanetary Transit Arbitration Secretariat (ITAS)

### Charter Claim
Neutral adjudicator of launch windows, transfer lanes, and emergency docking rights.

### Practical Mandate
ITAS appears technical but is deeply geopolitical. It can delay reinforcements, starve colonies, or protect allies by legal interpretation of lane conflicts. Fusion and transit constraints make ITAS rulings strategic weapons.

### Levers of Control
- Dispute jurisdiction over docking priority.
- Delay authority for safety re-certification.
- Dynamic lane congestion models consumed by military planners.
- Arbitration panels staffed by “independent” experts with hidden loyalties.

### Failure Modes
- Demonstrated bias toward Earth strategic needs breaks neutrality myth.
- Parallel Belt arbitration compact siphons legitimacy.
- Routing models fail under warfare conditions, exposing fragility.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 3-6: legal theater around chokepoint access.
- Books 7-9: operational pivot in Mars-Earth-Ceres campaigns.
- Book 10: candidate institution for postwar constitutional federalization.

---

## I-06. Consensus Safety Verification Directorate (CSVD)

### Charter Claim
Protects civilization from unsafe AI proliferation and misaligned autonomous systems.

### Practical Mandate
CSVD enforces the single-safe-AI doctrine by conflating competition with extinction risk. Some safeguards are real; many are monopoly protections. It is both guardian and gatekeeper, depending on viewpoint and era.

### Levers of Control
- Mandatory AI provenance audits.
- Hardware seizure authority for unregistered cognitive substrates.
- Safety incident narratives routed through controlled media channels.
- Interdiction partnerships with security units.

### Failure Modes
- Discovery that CSVD suppressed genuinely safer peer architectures.
- Overreach drives underground AI experimentation without guardrails.
- Internal ethical split after AI seed box evidence challenges official history.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 1-3: antagonist frame around seed custody and “containment.”
- Books 4-7: elite fracture inside safety doctrine professionals.
- Books 8-10: institutional conversion into pluralist safety authority or disbandment.

---

## I-07. Belt Mutual Aid Exchange (BMAX)

### Charter Claim
A cooperative clearing system for life support, spare parts, and emergency shelter among Belt stations.

### Practical Mandate
BMAX is the Belt’s survival mesh and soft-power engine. Initially local and improvised, it becomes the social substrate the Asterion League can build legitimacy on.

### Levers of Control
- Reputation-based credit and reciprocity ledgers.
- Emergency redistribution protocols activated during convoy loss.
- Community arbitration panels for debt disputes.
- Harbor commitments tied to shared risk pools.

### Failure Modes
- Predatory actors exploit emergency clauses during conflict peaks.
- Data integrity attacks on ledgers erode trust.
- Militarization pressure converts aid nodes into coercive checkpoints.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 2-5: alliance market credibility tests.
- Books 6-8: backbone for distributed industrial recovery.
- Books 9-10: test case for decentralized governance at scale.

---

## I-08. Asterion League Provisional Coordinating Assembly (AL-PCA)

### Charter Claim
Temporary coordination body to synchronize anti-monopoly security, fabrication sovereignty, and transit fairness across member polities.

### Practical Mandate
The AL-PCA is a fragile coalition mechanism, not a unified state. It exists to prevent anti-Consensus actors from losing through fragmentation, while avoiding creation of a mirror tyranny.

### Levers of Control
- Shared red-line doctrine: no single node captures all Class 1 chain knowledge.
- Joint verification bureau for contested evidence releases.
- Interoperability standards across mixed fleets and fabs.
- Rotation-based convening authority to reduce hegemonic capture.

### Failure Modes
- Crisis centralization creates proto-autocracy pressures.
- Divergent member war aims fracture discipline.
- Counterintelligence infiltration weaponizes mistrust.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 5-7: institutional protagonist structure for coalition politics.
- Books 8-9: wartime stress test during reconquest staging.
- Book 10: either constitutional seed of postwar federal architecture or transitional failure.

---

## I-09. Reconstruction Standards and Liabilities Bureau (RSLB)

### Charter Claim
Defines safety and liability standards for rapid rebuilding of damaged habitats, orbital infrastructure, and terrestrial systems.

### Practical Mandate
RSLB determines who bears repair costs and therefore who controls rebuilt territory. Standards are moral instruments disguised as technical guidance.

### Levers of Control
- Certification authority for habitat reoccupation.
- Liability allocation formulas after sabotage/combat.
- Blacklist powers for contractors tied to atrocity logistics.
- Public reconstruction scorecards influencing political legitimacy.

### Failure Modes
- Standards captured by victors to punish entire populations.
- Unrealistic compliance burdens delay life-critical reoccupation.
- Competing bureaus issue contradictory rules across theaters.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 8-10: critical to avoiding “victory equals humanitarian collapse.”

---

## I-10. Civilian Signal Trust Network (CSTN)

### Charter Claim
Maintains independently verifiable archives of public directives, casualty reports, and emergency orders.

### Practical Mandate
CSTN is society’s anti-amnesia mechanism. It reduces narrative monopoly by preserving authentic records across contested jurisdictions.

### Levers of Control
- Multi-signature publication for high-impact claims.
- Tamper-evident archive mirrors distributed across habitats.
- Public challenge windows before directives gain force.
- Crisis annotation protocols distinguishing rumor from corroborated events.

### Failure Modes
- Deepfake and synthetic-data attacks outpace verification cadence.
- Physical destruction of mirror nodes in war zones.
- Capture by ideologically rigid factions posing as neutral archivists.

### Book-Phase Relevance
- Books 3-6: credibility war infrastructure.
- Books 7-10: foundational for legitimate transition justice.

---

## Institution Interaction Matrix (Condensed)

- OCC + SFAB: turns scarcity management into political leverage.
- SACT + CSVD: legalizes monopoly safety doctrine.
- EDF-MPA + OCC: social exclusion pipeline feeds coercive marine contracts.
- ITAS + AL-PCA: determines whether coalition logistics can survive inner-system pressure.
- BMAX + CSTN: community trust and information trust reinforce each other.
- RSLB + SACT: postwar law can either entrench victor’s justice or stabilize reconciliation.

---

## Canon Guardrails for Use in Scenes

1. No institution is omnipotent; latency, corruption, and throughput limits always apply.
2. Institutions produce both order and abuse; avoid monochrome portrayal.
3. Any apparent procedural detail should have strategic consequences within 1-2 books.
4. If an institution solves a problem quickly, show displaced costs elsewhere.
5. Keep Asterion League institutional design plural and provisional until late arc convergence.

## Continuity Notes

- Supports `R-006` by giving Asterion League governance constraints without hard-locking one constitution too early.
- Supports `R-007` by separating safety verification institutions from monopoly doctrine.
- Preserves canon lock that strategic outcomes remain institution- and logistics-mediated, not tech hand-wave mediated.

## Continuity Note — Acquisition vs Training Data, Operator Status, Pursuit Awareness, Warform Taxonomy, and Small-Body Physics

- **AI acquisition event (LOCKED):** the AI seed/box is acquired in the **first-scene spec-ops extraction from the asteroid compound**.
- **Databank event (LOCKED):** the later databank raid is **not** AI acquisition; it is a **training/upgrade-data acquisition** event needed to expand/calibrate/harden the already-acquired AI.
- **Protagonist status (LOCKED):** crew exits EDF permanently when they steal Blackfly; they operate as free operators across coalition/civic/clandestine networks. EDF remains origin trauma/backstory only.
- **Escape-signature lock (LOCKED):** the compound nuclear strike covers immediate escape signature/tracks.
- **Enemy-awareness lock (LOCKED):** EDF/Consensus know Blackfly is missing but do **not** know current location. Pursuit uses probabilistic dragnet logic, not continuous direct tracking certainty.
- **Warform lock (LOCKED):** many hostile Spec Ops operators are fully overridden non-conscious human puppets driven by remote shipboard processor stacks (Class-1-line context). Treat as remote warforms in threat taxonomy and ROE; do not imply intact personal agency while full override is active.
- **Genre/frame rule (LOCKED):** narrative emphasis is **space opera first** with tactical realism, not ongoing EDF ownership framing.
- **Physics lock (LOCKED):** asteroid/small-body surface action requires explicit attachment/anchoring and attitude control; no normal walking depictions without active stabilization.
