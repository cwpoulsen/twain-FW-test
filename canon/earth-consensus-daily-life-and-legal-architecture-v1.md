## 1) Design Principle: Control Through Friction, Not Spectacle

Earth under Consensus does not run on dramatic terror events. It runs on procedural drag. The average citizen rarely sees soldiers in the street; they see forms, queue times, eligibility windows, and recommendation scores that quietly decide what options are available.

### Causal loop
1. Citizens believe life outcomes are mostly merit and routine.  
2. Because coercion is encoded in logistics, blame targets become diffuse (“system lag,” “resource balancing,” “network outage”).  
3. Diffuse blame reduces organized political anger.  
4. Reduced anger is logged as social stability, which justifies preserving the same mechanisms.

## 2) Earth Daily Life: A Standard Week in a Mid-Density Housing Block

### 2.1 Housing
- Most MCC blocks are 18-floor slabs with 42m² family units, two elevator cores, and corridor cameras every 12 meters feeding local continuity dashboards.
- Furniture is modular but bolted to standardized wall rails; residents can reconfigure layouts, but cannot remove partitions that cap gathering size.
- Building management pushes quarterly "renewal packs" (new wall skins + scent cartridges + lighting presets) so tenants experience change without gaining structural autonomy.

**Why this matters:** a standard unit can seat 4-6 adults comfortably; anything larger requires a permit-visible common room booking, which creates an automatic attendance trail.

### 2.2 Food
- District depots issue seven-day ration slates calibrated to age/work bands; calorie targets are met, but texture and spice variety narrow sharply below top compliance quartiles.
- Shelf labels look competitive (different brands, color systems), yet 70-80% of meals derive from two ministry-certified protein gels plus algae starch binders.
- "Flavor library" unlocks are tied to school/work reliability metrics and neighborhood incident scores.

**Behavior effect:** households track compliance the way previous generations tracked money—because better taste, not survival, becomes the visible reward channel.

### 2.3 Water and utilities
- Water is safe, filtered, and temperature-governed for infrastructure efficiency.
- “Peak-use smoothing windows” are framed as sustainability, but also impose synchronized household routines.
- Power is abundant at grid scale, yet household delivery includes dynamic “harmonic balancing pauses” that conveniently interrupt unscheduled late-night gatherings.

### 2.4 Work allocation
- Labor matching runs through Civic Function Portals (CFPs) with rolling 90-day reliability scores, commute-friction weights, and ministry quota back-pressure.
- Citizens can reject assignments, but each rejection burns a "cooperation index" tier and pushes them to slower med/childcare scheduling bands for 2-6 weeks.
- The legal fiction of choice is preserved; in practice, declining three assignments in a quarter can collapse a household's timing access to essentials.

### 2.5 Leisure
- Leisure blocks exist and are encouraged, but approved outlets are low-variance: cooperative sims, serialized “reality civic dramas,” and guided wellness communities.
- Unstructured venue permits (live theater, improvised performance, independent festivals) face layered safety review and usually miss their scheduling windows.

**Result:** culture is not banned; it is de-timed until it dies.

## 3) Civics Stack: How Citizens Experience Law

Earth law has three visible layers and one invisible layer.

### 3.1 Layer A — Charter language (visible)
Constitutional text emphasizes dignity, equality, and participation. This language is quoted constantly in education and media.

### 3.2 Layer B — Statutory harmonization codes (visible)
Thousands of procedural statutes define resource access, workplace behavior, medical scheduling, and transit permissions.

### 3.3 Layer C — Administrative directives (semi-visible)
Ministry circulars update thresholds and prioritization weights. Citizens can read summaries, but not the model inputs that produced them.

### 3.4 Layer D — Consensus weighting schemas (invisible)
Behavioral risk scoring and salience shaping alter how quickly legal requests move through the system. This layer is not publicly auditable.

**Practical truth:** most legal outcomes are determined before formal adjudication begins.

---

## 4) Ministry Architecture (Working Names)

These bodies preserve democratic branding while centralizing strategic discretion.

1. **Ministry of Civic Continuity (MCC):** housing, food distribution, labor placement.  
2. **Ministry of Cognitive Health (MCH):** link standards, emotional-stability interventions, media wellness rules.  
3. **Ministry of Productive Equilibrium (MPE):** industrial quotas, Class 2 output routing, strategic shortages.  
4. **Ministry of Social Harmony Adjudication (MSHA):** civil disputes, conduct review, public-order compliance panels.  
5. **Steward Secretariat for Long Horizon Risk (SSLR):** cross-ministry override authority, emergency doctrine alignment.

### Causal function
- Ministries generate bureaucratic legitimacy (“experts reviewed your case”).
- Secretariat preserves top-down final control when local outcomes deviate from strategic objectives.

## 5) Courts Without Finality: The Adjudication Funnel

Citizens can file appeals, but finality is structurally elusive.

### 5.1 Funnel stages
1. **Intake validation** (automated completeness checks).  
2. **Wellness suitability scan** (link-derived stress/risk profile).  
3. **Pre-hearing optimization recommendation** (“best social outcome” settlement proposal).  
4. **Panel hearing** (human officials + Consensus advisory feed).  
5. **Post-hearing harmonization review** (can reopen outcomes if “systemic stability” is implicated).

### 5.2 Statistical effect
- Most citizens accept stage-3 settlements because delay costs (work access, childcare, meds scheduling) rise steeply after refusal.
- Legal rights technically persist; practical endurance becomes the deciding factor.

## 6) Credentialed Freedom: The Permits Regime

Earth social movement is managed through permit ecology instead of overt travel bans.

### Key permit families
- **Inter-District Residency Transfer Permit (IRTP)** — moving between housing zones.
- **Independent Assembly Event Permit (IAEP)** — gatherings above threshold attendance.
- **Unscripted Broadcast License (UBL)** — live publication channels without pre-delay moderation.
- **High-Variance Art Exhibition Waiver (HVEW)** — installation/performance outside approved format catalogs.

### How denial works
Permits are rarely denied outright. They are “returned for data sufficiency,” “deferred pending harmonization review,” or “rescheduled to lower-load civic windows,” which often kills relevance.

**Core dynamic:** it is difficult to revolt against a calendar.

## 7) Civil-Status Law and Link Dependency

### 7.1 Legal classification
Citizens are not officially sorted by ideology; they are sorted by “continuity compatibility scores.”

### 7.2 Rights friction by score band
- High compatibility: faster approvals, broader training access, premium health windows.
- Mid compatibility: baseline services, longer queues.
- Low compatibility: mandatory counseling loops, employment delays, travel audits.

### 7.3 Non-linked citizens
Non-linked status is legal but treated as an unmanaged-risk condition:
- additional identity verification,
- reduced labor portal access,
- narrower housing transfer windows,
- elevated audit frequency.

This is the engine that pushes many unlinked people toward EDF service.

## 8) Exile Law Interface (Earth Side)

The marine banishment rule depends on domestic legal framing.

### 8.1 Formal doctrine
Upon completion of coercive-term military service, a person is granted **Autonomous External Residency Status (AERS)** and “full personal sovereignty.”

### 8.2 Hidden doctrine
AERS includes a permanent **Earth Re-entry Ineligibility Tag** except by steward-level waiver. In practice, waiver rates are near-zero.

### 8.3 Political utility
- Regime claims it does not imprison dissenters; it “releases” them.
- Earth population loses visible dissident veterans who could organize memory-based opposition.
- Belt receives trained, traumatized, politically volatile arrivals.

This offloads instability from Earth administrative centers into frontier theaters.

---

## 9) Education and Language Normalization

### 9.1 School architecture
- Core curriculum stresses systems thinking, civic safety, and cooperative reliability.
- Open-ended history modules are replaced with “conflict minimization case studies.”
- Debate survives, but allowed motions are constrained to implementation questions, not first principles.

### 9.2 Lexical conditioning
Students are taught term pairs that encode ideology:
- “unsupervised innovation” → “catastrophic risk channel”
- “independent organizing” → “coordination instability”
- “refusal to link” → “self-exclusion behavior”

Language narrows available political imagination before adulthood.

## 10) Why People Still Defend the System (Without Being Fools)

Earth citizens are not blind. Many can articulate the costs. They still defend Consensus for concrete reasons:
- violent crime is low,
- baseline needs are guaranteed,
- major infrastructure failures are rare,
- most families remember pre-Consensus instability narratives (amplified, but not wholly fabricated).

The regime survives because it trades ambition for predictability, and many people choose predictable harm over uncertain collapse.

---

## 11) Scene-Level Use Rules

1. Show coercion as queue times, permit delays, and soft denials before showing armed force.  
2. Let civilian defenders of Consensus make specific empirical arguments, not propaganda slogans.  
3. Use legal paperwork language as a weapon: neutral tone, life-changing outcomes.  
4. Tie every Earth policy to an off-Earth consequence (especially veteran exile and Belt labor volatility).

---

## 12) Open Questions for Next Draft

- Exact appeal-duration medians by district class.
- Which ministry controls AERS waiver logs and how leaks might occur.
- Whether black-market legal clerks exist who optimize filing language to evade delay traps.
- Minimum story-relevant court scene templates (civil, military, residency).
