## CP-005 — Databank Box Payload Lock (CORE)

**Rule:** The liberated box from sequence 0180 contains a **new AI seed/system**, not only static evidence payloads.

**Continuity effects:**
- Book 1 moral pivot now also becomes strategic ignition event.
- Information-war stakes in later books include AI custody/provenance control.

---

## CP-006 — Anti-Consensus Faction Identity + Class 1 Breakthrough (CORE)

**Rule:** Belt anti-Consensus coalition is named **Asterion League** and has created/fielded a Class 1 fabricator capability.

**Continuity effects:**
- Consensus Class 1 monopoly becomes broken-contested, not absolute.
- Escalation logic across Books 2–6 must reflect emergency regime response.
- Deprecated generic labels are disallowed as narrator faction names; use **Asterion League** per naming policy.

## CP-007 — Blackfly Strategic Fabrication Upgrade (CORE)

**Rule:** Blackfly fields a Class 2 fabricator stack.

**Continuity effects:**
- Team can influence strategic supply dynamics, not just survive tactically.
- Must still obey throughput/logistics/authority constraints; no unlimited fabrication.

---

## CP-008 — Series Scale Expansion (CORE)

**Rule:** Arc extends to ~10 books with phased reconquest of Earth followed by broader solar-system reordering.

**Continuity effects:**
- Books 1–4 become Phase I of longer campaign.
- Timeline scaffolds must now include Books 5–10 blocks.

---

## CP-009 — Quantitative Fusion/Transit Lock (CORE)

**Rule:** Mission travel and command timing must use explicit equations + assumptions + lane tables (including burn-coast-burn transfer mode defaults).

**Continuity effects:**
- No scene-level transit handwaving.
- No realtime Earth command fantasy in deep theater.
- Lane geometry state (favorable/median/unfavorable) becomes mandatory for timing-sensitive operations.
