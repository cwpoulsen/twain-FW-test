# Stewards of Progress — Canon Ledger v2 (Foundation Lock)

Status: **Core+Soft canon foundation**  
Scope: political architecture, control doctrine, strategic economy, operational constraints  
Continuity basis: `series/worldbuilding-core-pack-v1.md` + locked direction update (2026-02-17)

---

## 0) Canon Layer Key

- **CORE:** must remain stable across books unless explicit retcon is logged.
- **SOFT:** preferred current model; can be adjusted if later scenes force refinement.
- **RUMOR:** in-world belief with unknown reliability.

---

## 1) Setting Baseline

### 1.1 Date/era baseline
- **CORE:** Primary narrative window opens in **2055**.
- **CORE:** Civilizational effective innovation ceiling remains pinned near **2035 conceptual level**, with fusion-era exceptions.
- **CORE:** Main plot action is predominantly **off-Earth** (Belt/interplanetary military theaters).

### 1.2 Macro-geography and population
- **CORE:** Earth remains primary political center and highest-density compute/fabrication hub.
- **CORE:** Asteroid Belt hosts **multi-million** population distributed across mining habitats, refinery stations, and convoy nodes.
- **SOFT:** Belt demography skews younger and contract-labor heavy due to dangerous extraction economy.

---

## 2) Governing Regime Architecture

### 2.1 Formal state identity
- **CORE:** Earth’s formal political shell is the **Earth Democracy**.
- **CORE:** Real strategic authority rests with the **Stewards of Earth** (elite bureaucratic caste), who frame themselves as custodians of long-term human progress.

### 2.2 Machine authority
- **CORE:** Regime AI is named **Consensus** (from Project Consensus lineage).
- **CORE:** Consensus is high-scale behavioral/governance optimizer, **not** a superior creative superintelligence.
- **CORE:** Consensus sustains legitimacy by claiming to be the **only safe AI architecture**; peer AGI pathways are suppressed.

### 2.3 Human–AI division of labor
- **CORE:** Stewards define policy doctrine and social objective functions.
- **CORE:** Consensus executes policy via compliance shaping, allocation tuning, and narrative conditioning.
- **SOFT:** Feedback loops incentivize Stewards to overproduce control rules because control-success metrics map to status and lifespan privilege.

---

## 3) Neural-Link Control Doctrine

### 3.1 Adoption mechanics
- **CORE:** Neural links are publicly framed as voluntary.
- **CORE:** Adoption is functionally coerced through social/economic exclusion, not overt universal police-force implantation.

### 3.2 Control envelope
- **CORE:** Consensus generally avoids obvious hard overrides; it favors persistent low-amplitude nudging (emotion biasing, salience weighting, narrative repetition).
- **CORE:** Most linked citizens experience behavior as self-authored choice.
- **SOFT:** Link intervention intensity scales by perceived risk score rather than equal population-wide force.

### 3.3 Stratified autonomy
- **CORE:** Elite steward link stacks are materially different from civilian stacks and preserve greater executive freedom.
- **CORE:** Differential autonomy is justified internally as “entrusted cognition for strategic custodianship.”
- **SOFT:** Hardware keying + privileged firmware + legal immunity combine to enforce this autonomy split.

---

## 4) Social Contract and Material Life

### 4.1 Provisioning model
- **CORE:** Regime delivers universal baseline needs (food, shelter, healthcare) at controlled adequacy.
- **CORE:** Lived quality is intentionally flattened to reduce aspiration volatility.

### 4.2 Abundance theater
- **CORE:** Consumer choice is often simulated (cosmetic variation masking materially identical products).
- **SOFT:** Packaging/branding diversity functions as emotional pressure-release while preserving ration discipline.

### 4.3 Cultural suppression pattern
- **CORE:** High-variance art, independent theater, and unscripted civic culture are structurally disfavored.
- **CORE:** Public leisure is redirected into propaganda-compatible formats.

---

## 5) Fabrication Class Hierarchy

### 5.1 Class 4 (industrial backbone)
- **CORE:** Broadly available; produces hulls, composites, structural parts, wiring, standard electronics subassemblies.

### 5.2 Class 3 (general electronics)
- **CORE:** Broadly available; supports most consumer/industrial electronics.
- **CORE:** Excludes advanced microprocessor-tier capability.

### 5.3 Class 2 (strategic precision tier)
- **CORE:** Controlled access; outputs advanced chips, molecular materials, high-performance biomedical compounds, and room-temperature superconductors needed for fusion-drive infrastructures.
- **CORE:** Earth retains leverage over Belt by constraining Class 2 outputs.

### 5.4 Class 1 (AGI bottleneck)
- **CORE:** Produces quantum compute chip fabric for AGI-capable systems.
- **CORE:** Class 1 units can only be replicated by Class 1 infrastructure.
- **CORE:** Class 1 location/network remains black-tier secret essential to Consensus monopoly continuity.

---

## 6) Energy and Transport Constraints

### 6.1 Energy
- **CORE:** Fusion-generation capacity yields near-abundant electrical power for civilization-scale systems.

### 6.2 Propulsion
- **CORE:** Fusion drives dominate in-space propulsion.
- **CORE:** Fusion drives cannot operate in atmosphere.
- **CORE:** Earth-to-orbit lift remains chemical-rocketry constrained.

### 6.3 Strategic implication
- **CORE:** Planetary gravity wells are chokepoints; orbital transfer lanes become military-economic control surfaces.

---

## 7) Earth–Belt Dependency Geometry

### 7.1 Belt exports
- **CORE:** Belt supplies raw and semi-refined extraction outputs fundamental to Earth industrial throughput.

### 7.2 Earth exports
- **CORE:** Earth supplies select high-value Class 2 outputs (advanced microprocessors, molecular meds, superconductive components).

### 7.3 Control failure at distance
- **CORE:** Consensus behavioral fidelity drops with latency/infrastructure limitations away from Earth core networks.
- **CORE:** Belt populations are harder to cognitively steer in real time and more likely to form anti-regime counter-narratives.

---

## 8) Military Governance: EDF Marine Contract Trap

### 8.1 Recruitment pressure
- **CORE:** Unlinked or weakly linked populations face severe civilian exclusion pressures.
- **CORE:** EDF marine service is one of few legal routes to social function for these populations.

### 8.2 Contract terms
- **CORE:** Standard marine term = **5 years**.
- **CORE:** Marines carry governor-module constraints enforcing hard obedience boundaries.
- **CORE:** Violation/refusal triggers lethal enforcement.

### 8.3 Exit condition
- **CORE:** Completion grants legal freedom but with **permanent banishment from Earth**.
- **SOFT:** Policy rationale is framed as biosecurity + ideological contamination control.

---

## 9) Causality Chain (Locked)

1. AI scaling race (early 2030s) incentivizes centralized governance tooling.  
2. Project Consensus emerges as population-stability optimizer.  
3. Neural-link adoption expands via convenience and fear campaigns.  
4. Consensus acquires practical behavioral monopoly on dense populations.  
5. Rival AGI avenues are dismantled under “single-safe-model” doctrine.  
6. Creative risk and unmanaged innovation are marked as destabilizing.  
7. Civilization shifts from discovery civilization to optimization civilization.  
8. Space expansion continues for resource necessity, not liberation idealism.  
9. Belt distance weakens cognitive control fidelity; resistance ecology persists.  
10. EDF marines become expendable force balancing Earth leverage vs Belt autonomy.

---

## 10) Book-Series Pressure Rules

- **CORE:** Every tactical success must carry at least one strategic or moral cost.
- **CORE:** Consensus power appears strongest in dense institutional contexts, weakest at latency/friction edges.
- **CORE:** Steward ideology must remain internally coherent from their POV (no cartoon villain simplification).
- **CORE:** Off-Earth protagonists must experience Earth policy mostly through consequence, memory, and command effects—not lecture exposition.

---

## 11) Locked Contradictions (Use Repeatedly)

1. Equality rhetoric vs cognitive caste reality.  
2. “Voluntary” link adoption vs coercive material penalties.  
3. Claimed progress stewardship vs engineered innovation freeze.  
4. Civilizational abundance vs enforced low-variance human life.  
5. Earth dependence on Belt labor vs distrust of Belt autonomy.

---

## 12) Controlled Unknowns (intentional gaps)

- **RUMOR:** Whether an intact non-Consensus AGI shard survived purge years.
- **RUMOR:** Whether some steward factions seek to replace Consensus rather than preserve it.
- **SOFT:** Exact geographic distribution and hardening profile of Class 1 sites.
- **SOFT:** Full firmware architecture of marine governor modules.

These unknowns are preserved for plot maneuvering, not worldbuilding vagueness.
