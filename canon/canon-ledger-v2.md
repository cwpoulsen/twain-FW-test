# Stewards of Progress — Canon Ledger v2 (Foundation Lock, Updated)

Status: **Core+Soft canon foundation (updated 2026-02-19 curveball lock)**  
Scope: governance, fabrication sovereignty, military controls, timeline-scale direction.

---

## 0) Canon Layer Key
- **CORE:** stable across books unless explicit retcon logged.
- **SOFT:** preferred model; adjustable if later scenes force refinement.
- **RUMOR:** in-world claim of uncertain reliability.

---

## 1) Setting Baseline
- **CORE:** Primary narrative opens in **2055**.
- **CORE:** Effective civilizational innovation ceiling remains near **2035 conceptual level**, except fusion/fabrication war domains.
- **CORE:** Main action is off-Earth (Belt/interplanetary theaters), then scales toward Earth reconquest phases.

---

## 2) Regime Architecture
- **CORE:** Formal shell = **Earth Democracy**.
- **CORE:** Real authority = **Stewards of Earth**.
- **CORE:** Regime AI = **Consensus**, a high-scale governance optimizer (not omnipotent magic intelligence).
- **CORE:** Consensus legitimacy depends on “single-safe-AI” doctrine and suppression of rivals.

---

## 3) Neural-Link Control Doctrine
- **CORE:** Publicly voluntary, materially coerced adoption.
- **CORE:** Control favors persistent nudging over visible hard override.
- **CORE:** Autonomy is stratified; steward stacks have privileged freedom.

---

## 4) Social Contract
- **CORE:** Baseline needs are met at controlled adequacy.
- **CORE:** Lifestyle variance is deliberately flattened.
- **CORE:** High-variance culture is structurally suppressed.

---

## 5) Fabrication Hierarchy (Updated)

### 5.1 Class 4
- **CORE:** Industrial backbone (structures, composites, heavy maintenance).

### 5.2 Class 3
- **CORE:** General electronics tier.

### 5.3 Class 2
- **CORE:** Strategic precision tier (advanced chips, molecular med, superconductive components).
- **CORE:** **Blackfly currently fields one Class 2 fabricator stack**, giving the team strategic leverage beyond pure scavenger status.

### 5.4 Class 1
- **CORE:** AGI bottleneck tier; can fabricate AGI-capable quantum compute substrate.
- **CORE (updated):** Consensus no longer has uncontested monopoly certainty.
- **CORE:** A Belt anti-Consensus coalition named the **Asterion League** has successfully created/fielded a Class 1 fabricator capability.
- **SOFT:** Full topology and replication depth of Asterion League Class 1 remains compartmented.

---

## 6) Energy, Propulsion, and Transport Constraints
- **CORE:** Fusion generation powers civilization-scale industry.
- **CORE:** Fusion drives dominate in-space propulsion; no atmospheric fusion ascent.
- **CORE:** Earth gravity well remains a strategic chokepoint.
- **CORE:** Transit and command decisions must obey quantified travel/comms envelopes in `tech/fusion-transit-assumptions-and-lane-calculus-v1.md`.

---

## 7) Earth–Belt Dependency Geometry (Updated)
- **CORE:** Belt exports extraction throughput essential to Earth industry.
- **CORE:** Earth exports high-value Class 2 throughput but no longer holds guaranteed exclusive strategic edge.
- **CORE:** Consensus steering fidelity degrades with distance/latency.
- **CORE:** The **Asterion League** provides anti-Consensus Belt actors with an institutional alternative to ad hoc resistance.

---

## 8) Military Governance: EDF Marine Contract Trap
- **CORE:** Excluded/unlinked populations are funneled into marine service.
- **CORE:** Standard term = 5 years with embedded governor-module constraints.
- **CORE:** Refusal breach can trigger lethal enforcement.
- **CORE:** Governor behavior now constrained by explicit autonomy bands: `tech/governor-module-autonomy-bands-v1.md`.
- **CORE:** Completion grants freedom with permanent Earth banishment.

---

## 9) Causality Chain (Updated)
1. AI race centralizes governance tooling.  
2. Consensus becomes population-stability infrastructure.  
3. Link coercion expands quietly.  
4. Rival AGI paths are purged.  
5. Innovation narrows into optimization/control.  
6. Off-Earth extraction expands under Earth leverage.  
7. Latency weakens cognitive control at distance.  
8. Marine coercion sustains regime frontier violence.  
9. Blackfly escapes disposal logic and acquires strategic fabrication leverage (Class 2).  
10. Databank raid yields a **new AI seed/system** (“the box”), creating a non-Consensus intelligence axis.  
11. The Asterion League’s Class 1 breakthrough breaks monopoly assumptions and starts multi-book sovereignty realignment.  
12. Conflict arc extends through long reconquest phases (Earth, then broader solar governance order).

---

## 10) Series Pressure Rules
- **CORE:** Tactical win always carries strategic/moral cost.
- **CORE:** Consensus is strongest in dense institutions, weakest at friction/latency edges.
- **CORE:** Steward worldview must remain internally coherent.
- **CORE:** Long arc is now approximately **10 books**, with phased reconquest and post-reconquest governance risk.

---


### 10.1 Long-arc lock
- **CORE:** Series strategic horizon extends to approximately **10 books**.
- **CORE:** Books 1-4 cover betrayal->fracture->transition; Books 5-10 cover slow reconquest/reintegration of Earth and wider solar-system governance away from Consensus control.

## 11) Locked Contradictions
1. Equality rhetoric vs cognitive caste.
2. “Voluntary” links vs coercive exclusion.
3. Progress rhetoric vs engineered innovation freeze.
4. Abundance capacity vs constrained daily life.
5. Earth dependence on Belt labor vs fear of Belt autonomy.
6. Consensus monopoly doctrine vs emergent rival AI/fabrication sovereignty.

---

## 12) Controlled Unknowns (Updated)
- **SOFT:** True architecture and safety profile of the new AI seed/system from the box.
- **RUMOR:** Whether the seed is derivative, sibling, or adversarially designed relative to Consensus lineage.
- **SOFT:** Asterion League internal governance: coalition, cell network, or proto-state.
- **SOFT:** Exact hardening footprint of distributed Class 1 assets.
