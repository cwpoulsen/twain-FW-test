# Stewards of Progress — Canon Ledger v2 (Foundation Lock, Updated)

Status: **Core+Soft canon foundation (updated 2026-02-19 curveball lock)**  
Scope: governance, fabrication sovereignty, military controls, timeline-scale direction.

---

## 0) Canon Layer Key
- **CORE:** stable across books unless explicit retcon logged.
- **SOFT:** preferred model; adjustable if later scenes force refinement.
- **RUMOR:** in-world claim of uncertain reliability.

---

## 1) Setting Baseline
- **CORE:** Primary narrative opens in **2055**.
- **CORE:** Effective civilizational innovation ceiling remains near **2035 conceptual level**, except fusion/fabrication war domains.
- **CORE:** Main action is off-Earth (Belt/interplanetary theaters), then scales toward Earth reconquest phases.

---

## 2) Regime Architecture
- **CORE:** Formal shell = **Earth Democracy** (ballots, chambers, and legality theater remain intact).
- **CORE:** Real authority = **Stewards of Earth** (ministerial caucus and emergency boards hold actual firing authority).
- **CORE:** Regime AI = **Consensus**, a theater-scale governance optimizer (not omnipotent; bounded by data quality, latency, and compute placement).
- **CORE:** Consensus legitimacy hangs on “single-safe-AI” doctrine and aggressive suppression of peer intelligence lines.

---

## 3) Neural-Link Control Doctrine
- **CORE:** Publicly voluntary, materially coerced adoption (jobs, travel, and care access route through compliance).
- **CORE:** Control doctrine prefers a quiet leash—persistent nudging, reward shaping, and attention steering over obvious hard override.
- **CORE:** Autonomy is stratified; steward-grade stacks keep privileges denied to baseline citizens and contract troops.

---

## 4) Social Contract
- **CORE:** Baseline needs are met at controlled adequacy.
- **CORE:** Lifestyle variance is deliberately flattened.
- **CORE:** High-variance culture is structurally suppressed.

---

## 5) Fabrication Hierarchy (Updated)

### 5.1 Class 4
- **CORE:** Industrial backbone (structures, composites, heavy maintenance).

### 5.2 Class 3
- **CORE:** General electronics tier.

### 5.3 Class 2
- **CORE:** Strategic precision tier (advanced chips, molecular med, superconductive components).
- **CORE:** **Blackfly currently fields one Class 2 fabricator stack**, giving the team strategic leverage beyond pure scavenger status.

### 5.4 Class 1
- **CORE:** AGI bottleneck tier; can fabricate AGI-capable quantum compute substrate.
- **CORE (updated):** Consensus no longer has uncontested monopoly certainty.
- **CORE:** A Belt anti-Consensus coalition named the **Asterion League** has successfully created/fielded a Class 1 fabricator capability.
- **SOFT:** Full topology and replication depth of Asterion League Class 1 remains compartmented.

---

## 6) Energy, Propulsion, and Transport Constraints
- **CORE:** Fusion generation powers civilization-scale industry.
- **CORE:** Fusion drives dominate in-space propulsion; no atmospheric fusion ascent.
- **CORE:** Earth gravity well remains a strategic chokepoint.
- **CORE:** Transit and command decisions must obey quantified travel/comms envelopes in `tech/interplanetary-transit-and-comms-envelope-v1.md`.

---

## 7) Earth–Belt Dependency Geometry (Updated)
- **CORE:** Belt exports extraction throughput essential to Earth industry.
- **CORE:** Earth exports high-value Class 2 throughput but no longer holds guaranteed exclusive strategic edge.
- **CORE:** Consensus steering fidelity degrades with distance/latency.
- **CORE:** The **Asterion League** provides anti-Consensus Belt actors with an institutional alternative to ad hoc resistance.

---

## 8) Military Governance: EDF Marine Contract Trap
- **CORE:** Excluded/unlinked populations are funneled into marine service.
- **CORE:** Standard term = 5 years with embedded governor-module constraints.
- **CORE:** Refusal breach can trigger lethal enforcement.
- **SOFT:** Governor-module behavior remains constrained by hard obedience boundaries, with local initiative only inside permitted action classes.
- **CORE:** Completion grants freedom with permanent Earth banishment.
- **CORE:** After Blackfly theft, the core crew are permanently post-EDF free operators and cannot be written back into EDF command.

---

## 9) Causality Chain (Updated)
1. AI arms-race panic centralizes governance tooling under emergency doctrine.  
2. Consensus hardens into population-stability infrastructure and policy gatekeeper.  
3. Link coercion spreads by policy memo, contract clause, and access denial rather than open decree.  
4. Rival AGI lines are hunted, seized, or memory-holed.  
5. Innovation narrows into optimization-and-control sectors that serve regime continuity.  
6. Off-Earth extraction expands under Earth queue leverage and transport chokepoints.  
7. Distance latency frays centralized cognition and command confidence at the edge.  
8. Marine coercion keeps frontier violence deniable but persistent.  
9. Blackfly slips disposal protocol and gains strategic fabrication leverage (Class 2).  
10. Blackfly acquires a new AI seed/system in the opening spec-ops extraction; the later databank raid supplies training and upgrade data, not first acquisition.  
11. The Asterion League’s Class 1 breakthrough shatters monopoly certainty and starts multi-book sovereignty realignment.  
12. Conflict broadens into reconquest campaigns (Earth first, then wider solar governance settlement).

---

## 10) Series Pressure Rules
- **CORE:** Tactical wins carry strategic and moral cost.
- **CORE:** Consensus is strongest in dense institutions, weakest at friction/latency edges.
- **CORE:** Steward worldview must remain internally coherent.
- **CORE:** Long arc is approximately **10 books**, with phased reconquest and post-reconquest governance risk.
- **CORE:** Post-escape pursuit is probabilistic dragnet logic: adversaries know Blackfly is missing, not its current position after nuke masking.
- **CORE:** Fully overridden warforms are non-conscious remote instruments; portrayal and ROE cannot imply intact agency.
- **CORE:** Small-body combat requires explicit anchoring and attitude control; no normal walking/stance fighting without stabilization.

---


### 10.1 Long-arc lock
- **CORE:** Series strategic horizon extends to approximately **10 books**.
- **CORE:** Books 1-4 cover betrayal->fracture->transition; Books 5-10 cover slow reconquest/reintegration of Earth and wider solar-system governance away from Consensus control.

## 11) Locked Contradictions
1. Equality rhetoric vs cognitive caste.
2. “Voluntary” links vs coercive exclusion.
3. Progress rhetoric vs engineered innovation freeze.
4. Abundance capacity vs constrained daily life.
5. Earth dependence on Belt labor vs fear of Belt autonomy.
6. Consensus monopoly doctrine vs emergent rival AI/fabrication sovereignty.

---

## 12) Controlled Unknowns (Updated)
- **SOFT:** True architecture and safety profile of the new AI seed/system from the box.
- **RUMOR:** Whether the seed is derivative, sibling, or adversarially designed relative to Consensus lineage.
- **SOFT:** Asterion League internal governance: coalition, cell network, or proto-state.
- **SOFT:** Exact hardening footprint of distributed Class 1 assets.

- Governor constraints: `tech/governor-module-autonomy-bands-v1.md`


## 14) Destabilizer Faction Lock — Freed Voider Bands
- **CORE:** A destabilizer ecosystem of former EDF personnel exists after release/exile pathways; many are rejected by both Earth and Belt and survive as pirate/mercenary bands.
- **CORE:** These bands operate as chronic cross-theater disruptors of lanes, ports, and convoy trust.
- **CORE:** Strategic reveal: Consensus release pattern intentionally tolerated/steered this churn to seed persistent outer-system strife.
- **SOFT:** Degree of central coordination among bands remains variable by era and contract incentives.
