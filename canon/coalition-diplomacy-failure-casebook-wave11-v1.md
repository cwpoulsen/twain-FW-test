# Coalition Diplomacy Failure Casebook — Wave 11

Status: CORE-aligned expansion dossier for diplomacy failure modes under convoy scarcity and contested sovereignty.

## Case 1: Helion Grain Accords Collapse

### Trigger and Negotiation Frame
Asterion municipal delegates demanded transparent Class 2 spare-part audits before signing convoy grain guarantees. Steward intermediaries treated disclosure as intelligence leakage and substituted redacted payload attestations.

### Failure Mechanics
Belt ratifiers interpreted redactions as proof that relief shipments were bundled with covert surveillance hardware. Three compact councils suspended corridor cooperation, and neutral tug unions refused bonded escorts.

### Systemic Cost
Food reserves in two spin habitats dropped below ninety-six hours, forcing emergency ration codes and riot-prevention curfews. Blackfly cells lost a planned intake window because docking berths were reallocated to medical freight.

### Continuity-Safe Lessons
Asterion brokers later rebuilt talks using split-ledger verification: humanitarian cargo manifests were verified by independent dock mathematicians while security-sensitive metadata stayed escrowed. The model restored minimal trust but increased latency and berth turnaround overhead.

## Case 2: Peryon Prisoner Exchange Breakdown

### Trigger and Negotiation Frame
Consensus legal officers linked marine-prisoner release to immediate neural-link compliance oaths for dependents. Asterion negotiators argued that coerced civilian stack enrollment violated armistice custom under convoy duress.

### Failure Mechanics
Exchange vessels loitered in opposing vectors for thirty hours while both sides litigated oath wording. FVB raiders exploited the stall, struck two unescorted ore drifts, and broadcast footage to discredit both governments.

### Systemic Cost
Families on both sides concluded that formal law was theatrical cover for hostage logic. Recruitment into extremist protection clubs surged in stations where detainee relatives worked life-support maintenance.

### Continuity-Safe Lessons
Later exchanges succeeded only when oath language was replaced by phased supervision contracts tied to behavior audits rather than blanket cognition clauses. The compromise reduced ideological wins for either bloc but kept lanes moving.

## Case 3: The Janus Fuel-Merit Summit Failure

### Trigger and Negotiation Frame
Steward planners offered high-output reactor pellets only to municipalities that accepted Consensus arbitration primacy in all cargo disputes. Asterion caucuses saw the clause as sovereignty capture hidden in energy relief.

### Failure Mechanics
Municipal delegates walked out and signed emergency pooling compacts that redistributed low-grade fuel with severe efficiency penalties. Convoy schedules fragmented into opportunistic windows, raising collision and piracy exposure.

### Systemic Cost
Hospitals and water processors consumed backup stocks at unsustainable rates. Civilian legitimacy eroded because council leaders had promised predictable heat cycles before deep-shadow season.

### Continuity-Safe Lessons
A later salvage package decoupled fuel allotments from legal primacy and instead used rotating mixed tribunals with published minority opinions. Throughput recovered slowly, but doctrine now treats bundled relief-and-jurisdiction offers as likely bad faith.

## Case 4: Sable Truce Corridor Misfire

### Trigger and Negotiation Frame
Military liaison teams announced a forty-eight-hour demilitarized lane without synchronizing tug beacon standards. Asterion escorts and EDF auxiliaries interpreted exclusion radii differently by almost twelve thousand kilometers.

### Failure Mechanics
Both sides accused the other of probe incursions when sensor ghosts crossed mismatched perimeter maps. Insurance underwriters suspended war-risk coverage for civilian hulls during the dispute window.

### Systemic Cost
Merchants rerouted through longer cold lanes, burning extra coolant and extending delivery cycles beyond perishable tolerances. Civilian councils blamed negotiators for privileging symbolic ceasefire optics over navigational engineering.

### Continuity-Safe Lessons
The postmortem produced the Beacon Interoperability Rule: no truce lane announcement without jointly signed machine-readable corridor geometry and simulation playback distributed to captains six hours prior to activation.

## Case 5: Aegis Debris Liability Conference Breakdown

### Trigger and Negotiation Frame
After a reactor skirmish created high-velocity debris, both coalitions disputed cleanup responsibility. Steward jurists claimed insurgent initiation voided strict liability; Asterion attorneys argued proximate cause remained shared due to pursuit doctrine.

### Failure Mechanics
Cleanup tugs waited for indemnity guarantees that never arrived. Debris probability cones widened across commuter vectors, compelling mass shelter-in-place orders in habitats with minimal food slack.

### Systemic Cost
Public anger targeted legal elites whose argumentation was perceived as detached from orbital reality. Several neutral judges resigned after threats from families trapped in temporary sealed sectors.

### Continuity-Safe Lessons
A contingency norm emerged: emergency debris mitigation now auto-triggers a temporary joint liability pool funded by percentage skims from both wartime customs offices, with fault apportionment deferred until traffic safety is restored.

## Case 6: Kitewater Evacuation Compact Failure

### Trigger and Negotiation Frame
Asterion proposed shared custody evacuation for children from a vent-plague cylinder. Steward biosecurity command demanded exclusive triage authority and memory-redaction rights for all evacuees.

### Failure Mechanics
Parents rejected embarkation manifests, fearing permanent disappearance into Earth legal black boxes. Evacuation clocks expired as containment zones widened, producing preventable mortality spikes.

### Systemic Cost
The event became a canonical propaganda wound across Belt education streams: every later treaty debate invokes Kitewater as proof that safety language can cloak demographic extraction.

### Continuity-Safe Lessons
Subsequent health compacts mandate dual-chain custody logs, family witness channels with delay-tolerant recordings, and automatic tribunal review if any evacuee loses documented location continuity beyond one communications cycle.

## Case 7: Diplomatic Failure Pattern 7

In this pattern, coalition diplomats attempt to solve an immediate convoy, fuel, or prisoner emergency by fusing unrelated sovereignty demands into the relief instrument. The mechanism repeatedly fails because latency, distrust, and fragmented command chains make conditional aid look like strategic blackmail. Blackfly intelligence notes show that even pragmatic municipal actors become maximalist when families read a clause as irreversible loss of local agency.

Operationally, the failure begins with document asymmetry. One side circulates machine-dense annexes only to military lawyers; the other side circulates oral summaries to councils under time pressure. By the time full text arrives, convoys are already delayed and dock queues are saturated. FVB brokers then sell forged 'clarifications' to desperate captains, further degrading shared facts. Because Reality Gate constraints prohibit instant command correction, each correction arrives too late to prevent local overreaction.

The immediate outputs are predictable: convoy holds, emergency requisition orders, ration compression, and urban rumor cascades. The deeper continuity consequence is institutional fatigue. Each failed summit increases procedural overhead in the next one: more observers, more escrow, more conditional signatures, and narrower authority mandates for delegates. Diplomacy therefore becomes slower precisely when scarcity demands speed.

Continuity-safe doctrine recommends three guardrails. First, keep life-support cargo agreements textually separate from status or jurisdiction settlements. Second, require precomputed latency calendars so no side can exploit delayed clarifications as tactical ambiguity. Third, attach consequence ledgers that force negotiators to publish expected civilian losses if talks stall beyond specific hour marks.

## Case 16: Relay-Custody Recognition Deadlock

### Trigger and Negotiation Frame
Asterion mediators proposed that emergency relay stations be treated as neutral humanitarian infrastructure even when physically hosted in Compact jurisdictions sympathetic to Blackfly couriers. Steward delegates accepted neutrality in principle but required remote firmware escrow keys that would permit later forensic extraction by Consensus investigators.

### Failure Mechanics
Compact councils interpreted escrow as retroactive intelligence annexation and refused key deposit. Without mutual recognition, relay stations downshifted to local traffic only, severing long-haul legal notice flows for appeals, cargo stays, and casualty notifications. Judges in three lane courts began issuing non-enforceable placeholder rulings because party service could not be confirmed inside statutory windows.

### Systemic Cost
Administrative darkness multiplied rumor governance. Families with detained relatives received contradictory reports and paid predatory brokers for unverifiable updates. Convoy insurers priced uncertainty surcharges into all routes crossing the dark segment, diverting cargo from already fragile civilian habitats. The political effect was corrosive: each bloc blamed the other for broken due process while simultaneously benefiting from plausible deniability.

### Continuity-Safe Lessons
The eventual bridge model separated relay neutrality from investigative access. Stations now maintain one-way legal notification channels with cryptographic attestations while any forensic pull requires a separate tribunal warrant signed by mixed-jurisdiction judges. This design is slower than unilateral escrow but prevents emergency communications infrastructure from becoming a covert capture mechanism.

## Case 17: Armistice Language Drift Across Latency Bands

### Trigger and Negotiation Frame
An armistice text approved near Earth used legal terms whose Belt practice meanings had shifted over years of scarcity governance. By the time authenticated copies reached outer lanes, councils had already implemented local interpretations that contradicted steward military intent.

### Failure Mechanics
Because one-way delay exceeded political reaction time, each side treated the other's implementation as intentional deception. Tactical patrols detained survey craft under one reading while municipal courts ordered release under another. The legal conflict escalated into kinetic warning burns that consumed propellant needed for medical convoy shepherding.

### Systemic Cost
Civilian administrators absorbed cascading burden: court dockets tripled, depot inventories misaligned, and fatigue errors increased among overworked signal clerks reconciling version trees. The episode demonstrated that text alone cannot carry legitimacy across lag-distorted governance space.

### Continuity-Safe Lessons
Armistice packets now include executable interpretation tables, glossary hashes, and scenario examples validated by both blocs before release. The governance insight is procedural humility: in a latency-bound system, semantic precision is humanitarian infrastructure, not legal ornament.

## Meta-Pattern Note: Why Failure Persists Despite Experienced Negotiators

Coalition diplomacy fails repeatedly not because parties lack technical competence, but because institutional incentives reward positional signaling over corridor survivability during early bargaining rounds. Delegates are evaluated by internal hardliners watching delayed transcripts, not by immediate civilian outcomes in distant habitats. Under latency, that audience effect worsens: by the time practical concessions prove life-saving, political patrons may already have condemned them as weakness.

Continuity-safe storytelling should therefore depict negotiators as trapped actors optimizing under misaligned accountability clocks. Successful agreements emerge only when process redesign changes who bears visible blame for delay. Mechanisms include civilian-loss counters, mandatory publication of hold-duration consequences, and mixed verification teams that reduce opportunities for curated ambiguity. These tools do not eliminate conflict; they alter payoff geometry so procedural cooperation becomes politically survivable.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Asterion League naming preserved; no deprecated coalition labels used in narrator voice.
- Blackfly remains post-EDF free-operator actor; no reintegration into EDF command implied.
- AI timeline lock respected (opening acquisition vs later databank training split not inverted).
- Class ladder references preserved (Class 4/3/2/1 with Blackfly C2, Asterion fragile C1).
- Unknown-position pursuit logic retained after nuke masking; no omniscient tracking claims.
- Warform doctrine preserved as non-conscious remote instrument distinct from human agency.
- FVB destabilizer ecology represented as persistent plural ecosystem.
- Reality Gate constraints (latency, logistics, fatigue) treated as hard limits in every case.
