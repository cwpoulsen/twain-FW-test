# Event Summary
What happened, in 3-6 lines.

## Cause
-

## Consequence
-

## Technical Constraints
- Physics/engineering assumptions in play:
- Comms lag / travel time implications:
- Resource constraints:

## Continuity Checks
- [ ] No contradiction with prior core events
- [ ] Sequence index is globally consistent
- [ ] Character presence plausible by travel/time math
- [ ] Tech constraints respected
