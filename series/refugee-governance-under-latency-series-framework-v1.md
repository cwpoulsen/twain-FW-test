# Refugee Governance Under Latency — Series Framework v1

Scope: Books 2-10 governance architecture and narrative integration notes.

## Latency-Governed Refugee Polity Arc (Books 2-8)
Refugee governance is a core ideological proving ground: emergency shelter -> corridor compacts -> contested constitutional incorporation.

## Representative Mechanisms Under Comms Delay
Issue-scoped delegate bundles, revocable proxies, and asynchronous deliberation windows with explicit fallback rules.

## Refugee Labor and Dignity Economics
Consent gradients, wage-floor protections, anti-coercion audits, and off-ramp competition against predatory labor markets.

## Refugee Justice Episodes and Adjudication Dramas
Operational hearings (not Earth courtroom mimicry): confidence-banded findings, provisional remedies, costly correction paths.

## Integration with Reconquest and Post-Reconquest Risk
Recentralization pressure is an explicit post-victory risk; corridor institutions may be absorbed, sidelined, or captured.

## Reconciled Escalation Modules (de-duplicated)
### Book-by-Book Refugee Governance Escalation Beats
Track governance strain by book phase with institutional cost accounting.

### Family Reunification Bureaucracy as Character Engine
Identity proof, kin-link verification delays, and reunification backlog as recurring emotional/governance driver.

### Education, Apprenticeship, and Civic Identity in Transit
Portable credentialing and apprenticeship channels prevent generational exclusion.

### Faith, Ritual, and Secular Mediation in Dense Shelters
Plural mediation frameworks reduce sectarian capture of aid governance.

### Gendered Safety Design in Temporary Municipal Nodes
Lighting, movement routing, reporting channels, and protection protocols are first-order governance infrastructure.

### Narrative Metrics for Governance Credibility
Measure time-to-interim-protection, reversal rates, compensation completion, and trust stability by corridor class.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Governance mechanisms remain asynchronous and latency-realistic.
- Rights clocks and interim protections prevent bureaucratic void retcons.
- Labor policy avoids shelter-for-work coercive equivalence.
- Reconquest integration models recentralization/capture risk explicitly.
