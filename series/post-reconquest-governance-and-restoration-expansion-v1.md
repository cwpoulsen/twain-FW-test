# Post-Reconquest Governance and Restoration Framework (Expansion v1)

Purpose: continuity-safe implementation scaffold for post-reconquest governance, industrial restoration, and anti-relapse legitimacy building.

Method rule: every policy beat is written as **mechanism -> decision -> cost** under hard constraints (latency, logistics, maintenance debt, fatigue, legal auditability). Read each section as an execution chain, not a wish list.

---

## I. First 540 Days: stabilization without relapse

### Phase A (Days 0-90): stop collapse
- **Mechanism:** emergency service triage cells map water, med, power, and convoy vulnerability by confidence bands.
- **Decision:** prioritize life-support corridors over prestige reconstruction.
- **Cost:** political backlash from districts that see visible delays and unequal queue outcomes.

### Phase B (Days 91-240): lawful control transfer
- **Mechanism:** coercive tools are reclassified by harm-band and legal trigger.
- **Decision:** retain selected experienced operators under supervised sunset mandates instead of total purge.
- **Cost:** survivors read continuity staffing as impunity risk unless evidentiary oversight is public and enforceable.

### Phase C (Days 241-540): legitimacy through service reliability
- **Mechanism:** procurement shifts to auditable lot registries with mirrored custody logs.
- **Decision:** institutionalize mixed Earth-Belt adjudication panels with municipal concurrence gates.
- **Cost:** implementation speed slows; verification overhead consumes scarce administrative talent.

## II. Anti-relapse governance stack

1. **Emergency power expiration:** crisis authorities auto-expire unless renewed by supermajority + municipal concurrence.
2. **Evidence primacy:** high-impact claims require mirrored publication/custody paths.
3. **Delegation accountability:** time-scoped delegated command only; no anonymous executive chains.
4. **Warform doctrine lock:** fully overridden warforms treated as non-conscious remote assets; liability remains human.
5. **Link-rights lock:** employment, travel, and emergency care cannot be conditioned on neural-link enrollment.
6. **Contradiction docket:** any law whose implementation violates its stated equity claim is paused pending repair.

## III. Industrial restoration under fabrication scarcity

### Throughput hierarchy (locked)
- Class 4/3 baseline distributed production
- Blackfly constrained Class 2 leverage
- Asterion League fragile Class 1 strategic leverage

### Allocation principles
- Medical cold-chain, life-support spares, and convoy safety components outrank prestige projects.
- Burn-class and maintenance debt must be declared with each high-thrust logistics plan.
- Repair queues include fatigue ceilings for dock labor and inspection crews.

### Failure modes to actively police
- Hidden maintenance borrowing masked as productivity gains.
- Queue capture through emergency exception abuse.
- Counterfeit part substitution during salvage surges.

## IV. Security and FVB destabilizer management

### Core approach
- Suppression-only strategy is continuity-invalid.
- Mechanism: FVB persistence is fed by debt, coercive contracts, and blocked lawful exits.
- Decision: pair interdiction with recruitment-funnel disruption:
  - debt relief buyout windows,
  - conditional amnesty ports,
  - labor transition pathways,
  - contract-tracing prosecution of organizers/financiers.
- Cost: near-term political blowback and budget strain in exchange for lower long-run relapse pressure.

### Command constraints
- No real-time omniscient command assumptions across lane latency.
- Escort doctrine measured by arrival reliability, civilian loss reduction, and legal compliance—not kill counts alone.

---

## V. Legitimacy repair metrics

Mechanism: legitimacy rises or collapses through measurable service behavior. Decision: govern against these scoreboards, not speech cycles. Cost: publishing weak numbers invites attack but hiding them accelerates institutional decay.

Track these as narrative and governance scoreboards:
- service uptime reliability,
- queue fairness variance,
- evidence-chain integrity pass rate,
- tribunal throughput and reversal rate,
- convoy punctuality under declared burn limits,
- relapse indicators (black-market coercion rents, forced-compliance complaints).

Legitimacy rises through predictable small wins and honest uncertainty reporting, not victory rhetoric.

## VI. Narrative guardrails for scene expansion

A scene packet is invalid if it implies:
1. instantaneous inter-lane command correction,
2. unlimited propellant/ammo/repair capacity,
3. perfect sensor certainty in contested space,
4. zero fatigue/casualty carryover,
5. governance success without service tradeoffs,
6. Asterion governance cohesion without political friction.

## Continuity lock confirmation

- AI sequence preserved: opening extraction acquires AI seed/system; databank raid supplies training/provenance value.
- Asterion League naming preserved.
- Blackfly remains constrained Class 2; Asterion remains fragile Class 1.
- Pursuit remains bounded: Blackfly as missing asset under probabilistic dragnet.
- Reality-gate constraints remain mandatory for low-g/comms/logistics/fatigue.
