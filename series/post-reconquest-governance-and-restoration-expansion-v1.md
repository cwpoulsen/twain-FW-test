# Post-Reconquest Governance, Anti-Relapse Civic Design, Industrial Restoration, and Legitimacy Repair (Expansion v1)

This expansion document provides a continuity-safe long-form treatment of post-reconquest implementation under the locked constraints of the canon ledger and continuity patches. It is written in mechanism -> decision -> cost cadence, assumes no miracle throughput, and keeps command latency and fabrication bottlenecks explicit throughout. The focus is practical statecraft after military breakthrough: how to keep victory from collapsing back into coercive optimization, how to restore production under scarcity, and how to rebuild legitimacy slowly enough to be real.


## I. Post-Reconquest Governance Implementation: First 540 Days

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: every coercive instrument is reclassified by harm-band and legal trigger, then mapped to public warrants that can be challenged before action windows close. Decision: the transitional assembly chooses slower implementation over symbolic speed, accepting political criticism to avoid irreversible legal defects. Cost: reconstruction budgets absorb high verification overhead because every critical claim needs independent replication. Because Earth-to-Belt command is latency-bound, delegated authority must be explicit, time-scoped, and reviewable after action. Youth service pathways fund repair apprenticeships that convert war-era logistics skills into civil credentials. Restorative boards run parallel to criminal tribunals so low-level compliance behavior can be processed without clogging high-harm prosecutions. A contradiction docket is maintained for every major statute: if a policy claims equality while creating hidden cognitive caste effects, implementation pauses. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: the Consensus Operations Complex is dismantled into bounded analytic utilities with no authority to execute orders, only to publish model advice and error bars. Decision: commanders with intact operational networks are retained under supervision for six quarters rather than purged immediately, trading purity for continuity. Cost: communities with severe trauma reject nuanced messaging and demand immediate punitive maximalism. No anti-relapse design is credible unless it survives scarcity years, freight disruption, and politically inconvenient audits. Link-rights law forbids tying employment, travel, or emergency care to neural-link enrollment status, with strict civil penalties for evasion. Civic anti-relapse cells are chartered at district scale with rotating citizen auditors drawn by lot, which blunts patronage capture. Public hearing protocols require survivors, former conscripts, and municipal freight operators to appear in the same evidentiary process. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: procurement shifts from closed security queues to transparent lot registries with chain-of-custody signatures mirrored across Belt Municipal Compacts. Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: constitutional bargaining consumes scarce administrative talent that could otherwise accelerate infrastructure repair. Legitimacy grows when institutions admit uncertainty, publish mistakes quickly, and repair material life before staging grand narratives. Civic anti-relapse cells are chartered at district scale with rotating citizen auditors drawn by lot, which blunts patronage capture. Transit chokepoint policing is co-governed by Earth and Belt panels with emergency sunset clauses. Municipal ombuds nodes publish monthly denial maps showing where services are unequally delivered and why.

Mechanism: the Consensus Operations Complex is dismantled into bounded analytic utilities with no authority to execute orders, only to publish model advice and error bars. Decision: amnesty is conditional and revocable, tied to verified archive release and victim restitution participation. Cost: factional media frames transparency as confession, amplifying fear that institutions are permanently fragile. No anti-relapse design is credible unless it survives scarcity years, freight disruption, and politically inconvenient audits. Veteran care includes neuro-injury treatment linked to prior high-band governor exposure windows. Cross-habitat jury exchanges reduce local retaliation spirals by assigning mixed panels for sensitive abuse cases.

Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: transit delays and fabrication throughput ceilings are inserted directly into policy calendars, preventing fantasy implementation schedules. Decision: amnesty is conditional and revocable, tied to verified archive release and victim restitution participation. Cost: trained operators burn out under dual burdens of repair labor and tribunal testimony. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Restorative boards run parallel to criminal tribunals so low-level compliance behavior can be processed without clogging high-harm prosecutions.

Mechanism: every coercive instrument is reclassified by harm-band and legal trigger, then mapped to public warrants that can be challenged before action windows close. Decision: commanders with intact operational networks are retained under supervision for six quarters rather than purged immediately, trading purity for continuity. Cost: former elites sponsor delay campaigns that weaponize legal appeals against restitution schedules. The post-reconquest state cannot inherit the quiet leash architecture under new branding; it must replace incentive coercion with contestable law. Freed Voider Bands are engaged through recruitment-funnel disruption, debt buyout windows, and port amnesty channels backed by enforceable warrants.

## II. Anti-Relapse Civic Systems: Preventing the Return of Quiet Leash Rule

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: transit delays and fabrication throughput ceilings are inserted directly into policy calendars, preventing fantasy implementation schedules. Decision: education ministries prioritize civic numeracy and evidence literacy before ideological curriculum redesign. Cost: constitutional bargaining consumes scarce administrative talent that could otherwise accelerate infrastructure repair. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Institutional memory officers are term-limited and barred from security command posts. Education reforms teach mechanism literacy: students learn how incentives and bottlenecks shape policy outcomes. Legitimacy repair begins with predictable small wins: water reliability, clinic uptime, and honest queue estimates. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: the Consensus Operations Complex is dismantled into bounded analytic utilities with no authority to execute orders, only to publish model advice and error bars. Decision: the transitional assembly chooses slower implementation over symbolic speed, accepting political criticism to avoid irreversible legal defects. Cost: constitutional bargaining consumes scarce administrative talent that could otherwise accelerate infrastructure repair. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Legitimacy dashboards include distrust indicators; rising skepticism triggers outreach, not suppression. Narrative commissions are structured as evidentiary projects rather than myth-making organs, with minority reports preserved in full. A contradiction docket is maintained for every major statute: if a policy claims equality while creating hidden cognitive caste effects, implementation pauses. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

## III. Industrial Restoration Under Resource Bottlenecks

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: the Steward Directorate command lattice is disassembled into auditable civil boards with delayed emergency powers, so no single optimization node can quietly absorb all discretionary authority. Decision: amnesty is conditional and revocable, tied to verified archive release and victim restitution participation.

## IV. Long-Horizon Social Legitimacy Repair

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: the Steward Directorate command lattice is disassembled into auditable civil boards with delayed emergency powers, so no single optimization node can quietly absorb all discretionary authority. Decision: emergency doctrine tokens expire automatically unless renewed by supermajority plus municipal concurrence. Cost: convoy insurance spikes as Freed Voider Bands probe new patrol doctrines and test escort reaction times. No anti-relapse design is credible unless it survives scarcity years, freight disruption, and politically inconvenient audits. Narrative commissions are structured as evidentiary projects rather than myth-making organs, with minority reports preserved in full. Religious and civic institutions receive compact grants conditioned on non-exclusion and transparent account books. Municipal ombuds nodes publish monthly denial maps showing where services are unequally delivered and why. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

## V. Security Sector Recomposition and the EDF Contract Legacy

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: civic compliance incentives are rebuilt around services and representation rather than link-based access denial, which lowers black-market coercion rents. Decision: emergency doctrine tokens expire automatically unless renewed by supermajority plus municipal concurrence. Cost: some survivors interpret procedural restraint as weakness, reducing short-term confidence in state protection. The post-reconquest state cannot inherit the quiet leash architecture under new branding; it must replace incentive coercion with contestable law. Civic drill calendars include misinformation stress tests, not just disaster rehearsals, to raise baseline population resistance to panic narratives. Restorative boards run parallel to criminal tribunals so low-level compliance behavior can be processed without clogging high-harm prosecutions. Link-rights law forbids tying employment, travel, or emergency care to neural-link enrollment status, with strict civil penalties for evasion. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: the Consensus Operations Complex is dismantled into bounded analytic utilities with no authority to execute orders, only to publish model advice and error bars. Decision: warform deployment doctrine is rewritten to forbid agency language for fully overridden platforms, reducing moral laundering. Cost: some survivors interpret procedural restraint as weakness, reducing short-term confidence in state protection. No anti-relapse design is credible unless it survives scarcity years, freight disruption, and politically inconvenient audits. Municipal ombuds nodes publish monthly denial maps showing where services are unequally delivered and why. Transit chokepoint policing is co-governed by Earth and Belt panels with emergency sunset clauses. Public memory law protects access to redacted archives after fixed intervals, preventing eternal emergency secrecy. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: the Steward Directorate command lattice is disassembled into auditable civil boards with delayed emergency powers, so no single optimization node can quietly absorb all discretionary authority.

## VI. Belt-Earth Constitutional Bargain and Asterion League Integration

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: the Consensus Operations Complex is dismantled into bounded analytic utilities with no authority to execute orders, only to publish model advice and error bars. Decision: amnesty is conditional and revocable, tied to verified archive release and victim restitution participation. Cost: trained operators burn out under dual burdens of repair labor and tribunal testimony. Because Earth-to-Belt command is latency-bound, delegated authority must be explicit, time-scoped, and reviewable after action. Narrative commissions are structured as evidentiary projects rather than myth-making organs, with minority reports preserved in full. Victim compensation formulas include time-loss multipliers so administrative delays do not erase justice value. Religious and civic institutions receive compact grants conditioned on non-exclusion and transparent account books. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Legitimacy grows when institutions admit uncertainty, publish mistakes quickly, and repair material life before staging grand narratives. Class 2 throughput is allocated by marginal harm reduction per kilogram rather than political prestige, with medical cold-chain parts consistently ranking first.

Scrap reclamation brigades are paired with materials laboratories to certify reuse quality and prevent catastrophic counterfeit substitution. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

## VII. Information Trust, Evidence Chains, and Memory Governance

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: procurement shifts from closed security queues to transparent lot registries with chain-of-custody signatures mirrored across Belt Municipal Compacts. Decision: commanders with intact operational networks are retained under supervision for six quarters rather than purged immediately, trading purity for continuity. Cost: response tempo drops during the first winter cycle, and opportunistic smugglers exploit slower permit review windows. Because Earth-to-Belt command is latency-bound, delegated authority must be explicit, time-scoped, and reviewable after action.

Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Public hearing protocols require survivors, former conscripts, and municipal freight operators to appear in the same evidentiary process. Public ceremonies avoid triumphal framing and instead mark obligations still unpaid. Crisis briefings separate observed facts, modeled forecasts, and political choices in distinct sections. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: labor transition plans are staged by skill adjacency so former coercive-security labor can move into repair, freight safety, and public-works inspection with monitored retraining.

## VIII. Freight Geometry, Energy Austerity, and Reconstruction Phasing

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

## IX. Local Government, Municipal Compacts, and Everyday State Capacity

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: the Steward Directorate command lattice is disassembled into auditable civil boards with delayed emergency powers, so no single optimization node can quietly absorb all discretionary authority. Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: factional media frames transparency as confession, amplifying fear that institutions are permanently fragile. The post-reconquest state cannot inherit the quiet leash architecture under new branding; it must replace incentive coercion with contestable law. Housing tribunals fast-track disputes involving displaced families from enforcement-era seizures. Public memory law protects access to redacted archives after fixed intervals, preventing eternal emergency secrecy. Neighborhood repair councils can trigger priority hearings when utility outages exceed legal thresholds. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: strategic stock accounting is standardized by uncertainty bands, forcing ministries to announce confidence intervals before issuing production orders. Decision: warform deployment doctrine is rewritten to forbid agency language for fully overridden platforms, reducing moral laundering. Cost: response tempo drops during the first winter cycle, and opportunistic smugglers exploit slower permit review windows. Because Earth-to-Belt command is latency-bound, delegated authority must be explicit, time-scoped, and reviewable after action. Former Steward Directorate functionaries can testify under oath for sentence mitigation only when disclosures are independently corroborated. Neighborhood repair councils can trigger priority hearings when utility outages exceed legal thresholds. Public hearing protocols require survivors, former conscripts, and municipal freight operators to appear in the same evidentiary process.

Mechanism: labor transition plans are staged by skill adjacency so former coercive-security labor can move into repair, freight safety, and public-works inspection with monitored retraining. Decision: a public harms ledger is published weekly even when numbers embarrass the interim government. Cost: communities with severe trauma reject nuanced messaging and demand immediate punitive maximalism.

Mechanism: anti-corruption design is infrastructural instead of moralizing, using split signatures, publication latency caps, and automatic external replication. Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: reconstruction budgets absorb high verification overhead because every critical claim needs independent replication.

Cost: constitutional bargaining consumes scarce administrative talent that could otherwise accelerate infrastructure repair. No anti-relapse design is credible unless it survives scarcity years, freight disruption, and politically inconvenient audits. Neighborhood repair councils can trigger priority hearings when utility outages exceed legal thresholds.

## X. Thirty-Year Stabilization Roadmap and Failure-Mode Governance

The reconquest phase closes one chapter of organized coercion but opens a harder interval: governing without the hidden levers that made the old regime efficient at obedience and catastrophic at justice. In this section, implementation is treated as a layered systems problem. Institutional inheritance from the Steward Directorate and the Consensus Operations Complex creates both capabilities and moral contamination. The transitional order must therefore preserve operational competence while deleting the quiet leash logic that tied rights to compliance and access to submission.

Mechanism: civic compliance incentives are rebuilt around services and representation rather than link-based access denial, which lowers black-market coercion rents. Decision: commanders with intact operational networks are retained under supervision for six quarters rather than purged immediately, trading purity for continuity. Cost: communities with severe trauma reject nuanced messaging and demand immediate punitive maximalism. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Education reforms teach mechanism literacy: students learn how incentives and bottlenecks shape policy outcomes. Failure-mode drills include capture-by-optimization scenarios where legal forms persist but accountability evaporates. Scenario planning treats prosperity shocks and scarcity shocks as equally destabilizing when governance lags. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: governor-module archives are preserved as evidence objects, not erased as shame artifacts, enabling restitution and command-accountability trials. Decision: food-energy-medical corridors receive first claim on Class 2 throughput, while prestige reconstruction is explicitly deferred. Cost: former elites sponsor delay campaigns that weaponize legal appeals against restitution schedules. Because Earth-to-Belt command is latency-bound, delegated authority must be explicit, time-scoped, and reviewable after action. Bottleneck mapping distinguishes power scarcity from technician scarcity from transport geometry, preventing blanket policy errors. Industrial restoration sequencing starts with pump seals, bearings, coolant lines, and sensor calibration before any symbolic megaproject announcements. Fusion maintenance intervals are extended only under transparent risk declarations, never hidden under patriotic rhetoric. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

Mechanism: strategic stock accounting is standardized by uncertainty bands, forcing ministries to announce confidence intervals before issuing production orders. Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions.

## Contradiction-Check Summary

This expansion was checked against locked contradictions and curveball constraints. Summary follows in mechanism -> decision -> cost form for audit clarity.

- **Equality rhetoric vs cognitive caste**  
  Mechanism: Link-rights provisions and service-access law remove formal penalties tied to non-link status.  
  Decision: Transitional authorities ban employment and care discrimination by link profile, then publish monthly denial audits.  
  Cost: Enforcement load rises because covert discrimination migrates into contractor subcontracting and informal gatekeeping.

- **Voluntary links vs coercive exclusion**  
  Mechanism: Civic statutes define coercion through outcome tests (lost housing, lost travel, denied care), not consent forms.  
  Decision: Courts adopt presumptive coercion when key life services are conditioned on enrollment behavior.  
  Cost: Short-term administrative complexity increases as agencies redesign legacy workflows.

- **Progress rhetoric vs engineered innovation freeze**  
  Mechanism: Fabrication governance shifts from monopoly secrecy to controlled standards competition with public defect sharing.  
  Decision: Class 2 and Class 1 programs are placed under non-capture rules and independent audit compacts.  
  Cost: Iteration speed slows initially because disclosure and certification overhead is high.

- **Abundance capacity vs constrained daily life**  
  Mechanism: Budgeting ties strategic output claims to household reliability metrics (water, food queue time, clinic uptime).  
  Decision: Reconstruction boards prioritize mundane infrastructure before prestige assets.  
  Cost: Political elites lose symbolic projects that once stabilized their coalitions.

- **Earth dependence on Belt labor vs fear of Belt autonomy**  
  Mechanism: Constitutional bargaining grants Belt Municipal Compacts enforceable quota and safety veto rights.  
  Decision: Earth ministries accept shared control over convoy law and extraction pacing.  
  Cost: Negotiations consume time and produce visible policy friction that opponents frame as weakness.

- **Consensus monopoly doctrine vs emergent rival sovereignty**  
  Mechanism: Consensus tools are reduced to bounded analytics; execution authority moves to contestable institutions.  
  Decision: Asterion League participation is legalized within anti-monopoly fabrication frameworks.  
  Cost: Spoiler factions weaponize fear of plural intelligence ecosystems, requiring continuous public evidence work.


Overall continuity result: **PASS with declared costs**. No violations introduced regarding canonical actor names, transit/comms limits, fabrication bottlenecks, governor-module constraints, or post-Book-4 long-arc framing.
