## 10-Book Arc Dependency Grid (Strategic Layer)

| Book | Strategic Objective | Character-State Delta (net) | Faction Adaptation Response | Logistics Constraints (must be shown) | Handoff Conditions to Next Book |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Survive disposal, secure AI seed custody, preserve initial proof chain. | Hale: obedience -> conditional command autonomy; Valerie: vengeance impulse -> precision discipline; Isaac: tactical hacker -> custody architect; Lin: survivor pragmatist -> coalition broker; Marko: enforcer -> systems protector. | Stewards shift from cleanup to probabilistic dragnet; EDF hardens deserter narrative; Belt actors test Blackfly as asset vs liability. | BC-B/BC-C heat limits; no realtime Earth command at edge; ammo/coolant scarcity; low-g combat anchoring lock. | (1) Box custody protocol established, (2) at least one admissible evidence shard survives, (3) sanctuary network exists but is penetrable. |
| 2 | Build alliance-market legitimacy while protecting witness/provenance pipelines. | Team cohesion preserved under Valerie family-pressure faultline; Lin gains political authority; Hale accepts negotiated compromise doctrine. | Stewards pivot to disinfo + witness interdiction; local militias monetize neutrality; proto-Asterion interlocutors evaluate coalition viability. | Escort time tradeoffs vs own objectives; latency-distorted negotiations; med/oxygen convoy cadence limits. | (1) Witness chain partially externalized, (2) coalition trust protocol formalized, (3) unresolved personal sacrifice carries into B3. |
| 3 | Break monopoly-of-truth via synchronized proof + institutional custody; contest governor coercion legitimacy. | Isaac becomes legitimacy-systems lead; Marko reframes loyalty around civilian protection; Hale crosses preemption redline and publicly owns it. | Steward bloc fractures into hardliners/reformists; info-war cells escalate deepfake ops; PAC-like neutral bodies become decisive terrain. | Legal/archive operations near Earth with no deep backup; relay control impacts life-support; finite elite infiltration assets. | (1) Core atrocities become denial-resistant in key jurisdictions, (2) governance vacuum risk activated, (3) governor stack contestability evidence mature. |
| 4 | Prevent successor tyranny during transition; stand up interim anti-relapse institutions. | Protagonists shift from insurgents to constitutional custodians; Lin/Hale transition from tactical control to procedural legitimacy; Marko public testimony reshapes demobilization politics. | Hardliners attempt kernel reboot; reform coalitions compete for emergency mandate; labor blocs demand enforceable representation. | Earth gravity-well lift chokepoint; transit window scarcity; tribunal capacity bottlenecks; firmware rollout lag across theaters. | (1) Interim charter + audit regime standing, (2) bounded governor retirement path live, (3) conditional handover executed with rollback triggers. |
| 5 | Consolidate Belt governance and convert wartime coalition into durable command-economy alternatives. | Team influence decentered into institutions; Valerie reopens brother track through governance channels instead of rogue pursuit. | Asterion League moves from rumor-weight to treaty-weight actor; freed-voider bands (FVB) pressure weak peripheries; ex-steward technocrats attempt soft recapture. | Habitat maintenance backlog; fab allocation queue wars; convoy insurance collapse in pirate-heavy corridors. | (1) Belt charter bloc survives first stress cycle, (2) anti-FVB operating doctrine codified, (3) Class 2 allocation board retains legitimacy under scarcity. |
| 6 | Win industrial parity race without recreating monopoly rule; lock anti-capture controls for Class 1/2 throughput. | Isaac/Lin split over efficiency vs plural oversight, then reconcile around auditable constraints; Hale becomes strategic reserve leader, not central commander. | Adversaries launch procurement sabotage, standards wars, and capture attempts on oversight boards; black markets weaponize delay. | Throughput constrained by spare parts, coolant, and skilled labor; long-haul transit still months; inspection burden reduces output. | (1) Multi-party fabrication oversight survives sabotage wave, (2) emergency power sunset compliance demonstrated, (3) parity gains translate to civilian stability metrics. |
| 7 | Secure inner-system chokepoints (Mars-Earth-Ceres lanes) while preserving civilian legitimacy. | Marko drives anti-piracy ethics doctrine; Valerie becomes deterrence architect with tighter ROE; Hale forced into coalition arbitration between vengeance and law. | FVB plus hardliner remnants run convoy terrorism; Earth hard-publics back coercive reprisals; neutral traders demand enforceable corridor law. | Lane control cannot exceed escort fuel/maintenance budgets; false-positive targeting risk high; comm lag fragments command intent. | (1) Corridor governance protocol functioning (inspection + sanctions + appeals), (2) casualty trends decline despite operations tempo, (3) no mass-casualty legitimacy collapse event. |
| 8 | Stage Earth approach: synchronize political legitimacy, supply prepositioning, and limited military shaping operations. | Team accepts partial irrelevance as new actors (regional councils, labor blocs, defected command cadres) take center stage. | Earth incumbent systems split between accommodation and siege doctrine; propaganda intensifies to frame approach as invasion. | Earth ascent/descent limits; orbital staging stockpile risk; refugee and POW handling capacity becomes strategic limiter. | (1) Earth-side civil partners verified, (2) approach corridors sustainable for >1 campaign cycle, (3) Rules-of-Engagement consensus signed across coalition. |
| 9 | Execute Earth reconquest as controlled systems seizure, not annihilation; preserve postwar governability. | Hale and Lin prioritize continuity-of-life-support over maximal kill opportunities; Valerie resolves brother arc as political/moral choice, not only tactical objective. | Hardliners adopt countervalue blackmail; opportunist blocs seek wartime land-grabs; Asterion pushes conditional support tied to anti-monopoly guarantees. | Urban/orbital dual-theater strain; medical surge capacity finite; command latency between fronts causes miscoordination risk. | (1) Core control kernels neutralized or escrowed, (2) civil services continuity > collapse threshold, (3) war-to-law transition timeline announced credibly. |
| 10 | Build anti-relapse solar settlement: distributed authority, enforceable cognitive rights, bounded coercive power, and dependency treaty enforcement. | Protagonists relinquish emergency authority; identity closes as founders who step back, not permanent rulers. | Postwar coalition fractures into constitutional, revanchist, and extraction blocs; FVB reintegration vs suppression battle defines legitimacy. | Reconstruction scarcity, tribunal fatigue, and transit-limited oversight make perfect enforcement impossible; rollback triggers must be realistic. | Terminal condition: system remains imperfect but self-correcting; unilateral recapture pathways are high-cost, detectable, and contestable. |

## Failure Branches and Recovery Paths (Dependency-Critical)

### Branch A — Proof War Fails (Books 2–3)
- **Failure trigger:** witness chain compromised + deepfake campaign outruns verification.
- **Immediate effect:** coalition treated as one more propaganda actor; reformist stewards gain narrative high ground.
- **Recovery path:** pivot to institution-first custody (PAC/neutral arbitration), slower phased releases, independent forensic tool distribution via civic networks.
- **Cost of recovery:** tempo loss, higher near-term casualties, reduced protagonist narrative control.

### Branch B — Transition Captured (Books 4–5)
- **Failure trigger:** emergency charter lacks sunsets/audits; hardliners reconstitute “temporary” central override.
- **Immediate effect:** successor tyranny under anti-Consensus branding.
- **Recovery path:** trigger conditional handover rollback clauses; coalition-wide labor stoppage + relay transparency strike; external guarantor tribunal.
- **Cost of recovery:** supply shocks, public distrust spike, legitimacy debt for “second revolution.”

### Branch C — Industrial Parity Becomes New Monopoly (Books 5–7)
- **Failure trigger:** Class 1/2 oversight captured by technocratic/security elite.
- **Immediate effect:** fairness rhetoric with old coercive outcomes.
- **Recovery path:** forced key rotation, random external audits, quota transparency law with sanctions, open standards migration.
- **Cost of recovery:** throughput dip, black-market surge, sabotage exposure.

### Branch D — Earth Campaign Wins Militarily but Loses Governability (Books 8–9)
- **Failure trigger:** high collateral approach + service collapse in seized zones.
- **Immediate effect:** insurgency regeneration, revanchist recruitment boom.
- **Recovery path:** shift to life-support-first seizure doctrine, joint civil command cells, reparations logistics prioritized over territorial symbolism.
- **Cost of recovery:** slower military timeline, internal coalition conflict.

### Branch E — Postwar Relapse (Book 10)
- **Failure trigger:** emergency authorities normalized; cognitive-rights exceptions swallow baseline rights.
- **Immediate effect:** Consensus-pattern re-emerges under new banner.
- **Recovery path:** constitutional auto-sunset enforcement, cross-theater ombuds network, treaty-triggered sanctions against domestic power grabs.
- **Cost of recovery:** chronic low-grade instability accepted to avoid high-grade autocracy.

## Contradiction-Check Section (Pre-Draft Gate)

Run this check before expanding any book outline or chapter packet:

1. **No miracle logistics:** every strategic turn must show transit, comm lag, and maintenance cost.
2. **No monopoly whiplash:** Asterion Class 1 existence changes leverage, not physics or instant victory.
3. **No character reset:** state deltas above are cumulative; regression needs explicit trigger and consequence.
4. **No clean-win propaganda:** every tactical win must carry strategic or moral debt (canon §10).
5. **No governance shortcut:** emergency powers require sunset + audit + contest pathway.
6. **No EDF backslide retcon:** Blackfly core cannot be restored to formal EDF chain (canon §8).
7. **No false consciousness violation:** overridden warforms remain non-conscious instruments.
8. **No low-g handwave:** close combat and movement must remain anchored/attitude-controlled.

If any check fails, update: `ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md` and relevant canon/timeline patch file before drafting forward.
