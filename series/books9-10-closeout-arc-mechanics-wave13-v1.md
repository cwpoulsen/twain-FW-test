# Stewards of Progress — Books 9–10 Closeout Arc Mechanics (Wave 13) v1

Status: Closeout control layer for endgame execution (Book 9) and anti-relapse settlement (Book 10).

Authority anchors (apply first):
- `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`
- `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`
- `series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md`
- `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books8-10-wave12-v1.md`
- `timeline/books8-10-endgame-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`
- `ops/continuity-dependency-map-v1.md`

- `factions/black-market-interdiction-and-fvb-disruption-doctrine-v1.md`
- `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md`

Canon lock bundle (must hold):
- No miracle logistics, no realtime omniscience, no zero-cost victory.
- FVB remains a persistent agency-bearing destabilizer ecology; anti-piracy must include recruitment-funnel disruption, not suppression-only raids.
- War-to-law transition must constrain protagonist emergency authority before conflict residue is zero.
- End-state must be imperfect but contestable/self-correcting, with no clean-utopia closure.

## 1) Book 9 Terminal Conditions (War Phase Exit Tests)

Book 9 only closes when **all** terminal conditions pass in auditable form:

1. **Kernel Neutralization Condition (B9-T1)**
   - Threshold: all known core control kernels are either physically disabled or escrow-sharded under multi-party custody.
   - Evidence forms: custody logs, shard attestation chain, sabotage-window incident ledger.
   - Depends on packets: `B9-S01`, `B9-S05`, `B9-S08`.

2. **Governability Floor Condition (B9-T2)**
   - Threshold: life-support services remain above collapse floor across target megazones (oxygen/water/power triad continuity).
   - Failure trigger: any zone drops below floor for > defined crisis window without lawful remediation path.
   - Depends on packets: `B9-S02`, `B9-S03`, `B9-S06`.

3. **War-to-Law Credibility Condition (B9-T3)**
   - Threshold: transition schedule is published, notarized, and politically costly for protagonists (self-limiting by design).
   - Evidence forms: public law clock declaration, date-bound authority sunsets, neutral-bloc sign-on.
   - Depends on packets: `B9-S07`, reinforced by `B9-S08`.

4. **Countervalue Attrition Condition (B9-T4)**
   - Threshold: adversary blackmail capability degraded below strategic coercion level (can still wound, cannot dictate campaign).
   - Depends on packets: `B9-S02`, `B9-S05`, plus civil hardening spillover from Book 8.

**Book 9 fail state:** military seizure succeeds but civil-service continuity fails -> Branch D recurrence (win battles, lose settlement).

## 2) Anti-Relapse Governance Gates (Book 10)

Book 10 progression is gated by explicit institutional locks. No gate can be skipped “for efficiency.”

### Gate G1 — Emergency Key Surrender Gate
- Core test: protagonists transfer command keys before full threat extinction.
- Pass marker: operational slowdown is accepted without emergency clawback.
- Scene anchors: `B10-S01`.

### Gate G2 — Due-Process Load Gate
- Core test: tribunal overload handled by tiering/triage, not purge-speed jurisprudence.
- Pass marker: caseload control achieved while preserving appeal rights and evidentiary standards.
- Scene anchors: `B10-S02`.

### Gate G3 — FVB Funnel-Disruption Gate
- Core test: combine principal interdiction with reintegration lanes for non-principal cohorts.
- Pass marker: measurable recruitment-funnel shrinkage despite politically visible absconder risk.
- Scene anchors: `B10-S03`; doctrine lock via `factions/black-market-interdiction-and-fvb-disruption-doctrine-v1.md`.

### Gate G4 — Cognitive-Rights Constraint Gate
- Core test: security exceptions remain narrow, sunset-bound, and externally contestable.
- Pass marker: exception regime can expire automatically without executive grace.
- Scene anchors: `B10-S04`.

### Gate G5 — Treaty-Enforcement Credibility Gate
- Core test: sanctions/triggers can hit friendly violators, not only enemies.
- Pass marker: allied power-grab attempt is materially penalized through enforceable finance/logistics rails.
- Scene anchors: `B10-S05`.

### Gate G6 — Oversight Under Sabotage Gate
- Core test: ombuds/appeals network remains visible and lawful under communications attrition.
- Pass marker: degraded throughput, preserved legitimacy.
- Scene anchors: `B10-S06`.

### Gate G7 — Founder Exit Gate
- Core test: protagonists fail/decline permanent-extension bid and begin structured withdrawal.
- Pass marker: authority transfer persists through immediate instability.
- Scene anchors: `B10-S07`.

### Gate G8 — Stress-Test Gate (Terminal)
- Core test: simultaneous shocks do not trigger emergency recentralization reflex.
- Pass marker: uneven outcomes tolerated inside lawful correction pathways.
- Scene anchors: `B10-S08`.

## 3) Postwar Legitimacy Tests (Operational Scorecard)

Use as recurring adjudication rubric across Book 10 climax and denouement.

| Test ID | Legitimacy Test | Pass Signal | Failure Signal | Primary Scene Links |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Continuity over vengeance** | life-support continuity protected even at offensive tempo cost | punitive operations accepted despite service collapse | B9-S01, B9-S06, B9-S08 |
| L2 | **Law binds winners** | transition dates constrain coalition commanders before total pacification | commanders defer law transition until “after complete victory” | B9-S07, B10-S01 |
| L3 | **Due process survives load** | backlog triaged with rights intact | fast-track exceptional courts become norm | B10-S02 |
| L4 | **Dual-track FVB strategy** | interdiction + reintegration both active, with recruitment metrics tracked | suppression-only cycle regenerates pirate labor pool | B10-S03 |
| L5 | **Rights exceptions are bounded** | narrow language + auto-sunset + appeal channels | perpetual emergency exceptions normalized | B10-S04 |
| L6 | **Treaties bite allies too** | sanction trigger applied to friendly bloc violations | selective enforcement creates victor impunity | B10-S05 |
| L7 | **Transparency survives sabotage** | appeals visibility preserved despite latency/cable cuts | secrecy powers expand to mask governance failure | B10-S06 |
| L8 | **Founders relinquish permanence** | exit vote holds under fear pressure | “temporary extension” becomes durable command | B10-S07 |
| L9 | **System self-corrects under shock** | no unilateral recapture despite multi-crisis stress | recapture achieved through emergency central decree | B10-S08 |

## 4) Protagonist Team End-State Options (Choose One Primary, Keep One Shadow)

### Option A — Full Constitutional Exit (default canon-preferred)
- Hale/Lin/Valerie/Isaac/Marko retain advisory testimony rights only.
- Pros: strongest anti-relapse signal; clearest break from savior-state politics.
- Costs: slower crisis response; myth-gap exploited by revanchists.
- Best fit: if L1–L9 all pass at minimum threshold.

### Option B — Time-Bound Reserve Mandate
- Team exits executive posts but serves on emergency reserve board with strict expiry + external veto.
- Pros: cushions transition fragility.
- Costs: higher relapse suspicion; requires stronger G4/G7 safeguards.
- Best fit: if L1/L2 pass but L7/L9 remain fragile.

### Option C — Fragmented Exit / Divergent Paths
- Some protagonists fully retire; others stay in bounded institutional roles (ombuds, tribunal support, convoy oversight).
- Pros: highest character realism for postwar unevenness.
- Costs: can read as soft power retention unless hard limits are explicit.
- Best fit: if legitimacy is mixed and coalition fragmentation is politically unavoidable.

### Option D — Failed Exit (negative branch, use only as alt/failure timeline)
- Extension pressure wins; founders retain emergency command “temporarily.”
- Outcome: anti-relapse architecture hollowed, Branch E reactivation.

## 6) Contradiction-Check Summary (Wave 13 Closeout Mechanics)

- **No miracle logistics drift:** preserved; every gate assumes transit/throughput scarcity and delayed enforcement rails.
- **No latency/omniscience drift:** preserved; tests rely on notarized and delayed verification chains, not instant command certainty.
- **No governance shortcut drift:** preserved; Book 10 progression is gate-locked, not leader-discretion based.
- **No suppression-only FVB drift:** preserved; Gate G3 requires recruitment-funnel disruption plus reintegration track.
- **No protagonist-permanence drift:** preserved; end-state options make permanent emergency command a failure branch.
- **No clean-win ending drift:** preserved; terminal condition remains imperfect, contested, and self-correcting.

Implementation note:
- If any gate or legitimacy test fails in drafted scenes, log in `ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md` and patch packet/dependency docs before forward drafting.
