# Coalition Fracture/Repair Arc Atlas (Books 2-10) v1


This atlas turns strategic continuity locks into repeatable narrative engines. Every phase assumes Blackfly remains a post-EDF free operator team with constrained Class 2 leverage; Asterion League remains politically fragile despite Class 1 breakthrough; and outer-system command loops remain latency-bound.

## Book 2: fracture pressure, repair attempt, and institutional residue

Fracture trigger: a governance promise is made at coalition scale, then violated by lane reality, covert incentives, or evidence uncertainty. Repair mechanism: actors build narrower agreements with stricter verification and explicit loss-sharing. Residue: no repair is total; each leaves scar tissue that shapes later command trust.

- Beat 1: Task force negotiates corridor access; FVB brokers test convoy defenses with deniable raids; municipal councils debate whether emergency powers should sunset now or after one additional transfer cycle. Blackfly provides fabrication triage and custody audit tooling but cannot scale to universal relief. Asterion League delegates split between expansionists and consolidation caucus, producing partial compliance rather than unified doctrine.

Scene-level continuity notes: first-scene AI acquisition remains past-tense foundation; databank operations in later books emphasize training data, model hardening, and provenance warfare. Nuclear signature masking from exfil remains historical cause for uncertainty in adversary tracking models.

Warform doctrine note: fully overridden warforms are remote instruments with command/legal accountability on controllers; agency-bearing human operators must remain ethically and legally distinct in every ROE debate.

Scene-level continuity notes: first-scene AI acquisition remains past-tense foundation; databank operations in later books emphasize training data, model hardening, and provenance warfare. Nuclear signature masking from exfil remains historical cause for uncertainty in adversary tracking models.

Warform doctrine note: fully overridden warforms are remote instruments with command/legal accountability on controllers; agency-bearing human operators must remain ethically and legally distinct in every ROE debate.

## Book 9: fracture pressure, repair attempt, and institutional residue

Fracture trigger: a governance promise is made at coalition scale, then violated by lane reality, covert incentives, or evidence uncertainty. Repair mechanism: actors build narrower agreements with stricter verification and explicit loss-sharing. Residue: no repair is total; each leaves scar tissue that shapes later command trust.

## Cross-book coalition repair toolkit

- Reciprocal audit teams rotating across hostile ports: designed to reduce opportunistic betrayal and convert rumor-driven escalation into evidence-driven bargaining. Success condition is not harmony; success is predictable disagreement that does not collapse life-support systems.

- Loss-sharing ledgers tied to convoy insurance pools: designed to reduce opportunistic betrayal and convert rumor-driven escalation into evidence-driven bargaining. Success condition is not harmony; success is predictable disagreement that does not collapse life-support systems.

- Third-party custody chains for AI training artifacts: designed to reduce opportunistic betrayal and convert rumor-driven escalation into evidence-driven bargaining. Success condition is not harmony; success is predictable disagreement that does not collapse life-support systems.

- Temporary lane demilitarization contracts with inspection windows: designed to reduce opportunistic betrayal and convert rumor-driven escalation into evidence-driven bargaining. Success condition is not harmony; success is predictable disagreement that does not collapse life-support systems.

- Reintegration stipends for ex-EDF personnel not tied to coercive enlistment: designed to reduce opportunistic betrayal and convert rumor-driven escalation into evidence-driven bargaining. Success condition is not harmony; success is predictable disagreement that does not collapse life-support systems.

- Warform incident review tribunals with public redaction standards: designed to reduce opportunistic betrayal and convert rumor-driven escalation into evidence-driven bargaining. Success condition is not harmony; success is predictable disagreement that does not collapse life-support systems.

- Public repair metrics dashboards separating propaganda from throughput: designed to reduce opportunistic betrayal and convert rumor-driven escalation into evidence-driven bargaining. Success condition is not harmony; success is predictable disagreement that does not collapse life-support systems.

- Dispute cooling protocols requiring 72-hour evidence freeze before retaliation: designed to reduce opportunistic betrayal and convert rumor-driven escalation into evidence-driven bargaining. Success condition is not harmony; success is predictable disagreement that does not collapse life-support systems.
