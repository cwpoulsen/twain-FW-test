## Scope and Intent
This volume adds continuity-safe strategic material for four pressure domains: inter-faction diplomacy under latency, Blackfly-era coalition command friction, frontier justice case clusters, and civilian resilience systems. It is written as bible-grade operations prose rather than scene draft copy, so downstream scene packets can pull directly from doctrine, constraints, and consequence models without introducing canon drift.

## I. Inter-Faction Diplomacy Under Latency

### I.1 Diplomatic Physics: Why Latency Is Political, Not Merely Technical
In the Earth-Belt system, diplomatic meaning does not travel at the speed of intent. It travels at the speed of light plus queue delay plus authentication delay plus decryption window plus local deliberation and factional fear. Every negotiated phrase therefore bifurcates into at least three realities: what the sender believed it said, what the receiver first interpreted under incomplete context, and what both sides later claim was always obvious once casualties and shortages altered incentives. This delay-stack makes sincerity harder to demonstrate and easier to counterfeit. Actors that can tolerate ambiguity gain leverage over actors that require immediate closure.

Latency reshapes bargaining posture in five repeatable ways. First, it rewards pre-commitment language: parties that publish trigger conditions and fallback behavior before crisis spikes are harder to manipulate by forged urgency. Second, it privileges modular agreements over monolithic treaties, because a delayed correction to one module does not collapse the entire framework. Third, it introduces temporal asymmetry in domestic legitimacy: a coalition cabinet may ratify an offer that local dock labor will reject before acknowledgment returns, producing “authorized but socially void” commitments. Fourth, it creates deliberate deniability markets: freight guilds, convoy insurers, and militia councils can claim misunderstanding as a structural defense rather than moral failure. Fifth, it transforms intelligence provenance into diplomatic currency; the side that can prove chain-of-custody under stale conditions can recover trust faster than the side that merely sounds coherent.

In this operating environment, a negotiation is less a table and more a braided relay with multiple sovereign clocks. The Asterion League’s fragility compounds this: member habitats, industrial enclaves, and convoy councils possess divergent risk thresholds and memory of Earth coercion. A phrase that reads like de-escalation to one node may read like stealth re-subordination to another. Successful diplomacy therefore requires interval design: each round must specify not only terms but also expected delay, confirmation path, and explicit no-action windows where tactical commanders are forbidden to “interpret silence” as hostile refusal.

### I.2 Latency-Native Treaty Architecture
Treaty design in this setting must be written against hard delay intervals rather than idealized conversation tempo. A standard diplomatic packet contains: intent statement, bounded claims, evidence hashes, expected acknowledgment interval, and contingent behavior if acknowledgment fails. This packet logic prevents command echelons from improvising contradictory interpretations while messages are in flight. Parties that skip packetization tend to generate accidental escalations because local officers substitute threat heuristics for policy.

A recurring method is the staggered ratification ladder. Local node councils pre-authorize a narrow options tree before transmission; when return traffic arrives, they can execute within pre-vetted bounds instead of reopening full constitutional argument. This does not remove politics, but it narrows the ambiguity corridor where spoilers operate. FVB intermediaries and opportunist brokers frequently target this corridor by forging “urgent clarifications,” hoping one side acts before full checksum verification. Diplomatic doctrine therefore requires checksum-first, emotion-second response discipline, especially after attacks on mixed civilian/military infrastructure.

The Asterion League benefits from publishing dissent maps with each external message: annexes describing which sub-factions object, on what grounds, and what compensatory concessions may quiet the dispute. Transparency about internal disagreement appears weak in short-form propaganda but performs strongly under latency because it reduces surprise reversals. Counterparties can model probable drift and avoid over-committing to language a fragile coalition cannot uphold.

Earth-aligned negotiators typically exploit tempo panic: they inject high-moral language tied to rapidly expiring windows, then accuse delay as proof of bad faith. Latency-aware Belt actors counter by treating imposed clocks as negotiable objects. A credible counter-message states: “Window acknowledged, validation path attached, interim behavior locked, final position pending verified casualty and logistics updates.” This preserves legitimacy while denying tempo capture.

Operationally, diplomacy teams maintain “deadman civility clauses.” If either side loses comms continuity beyond a threshold, pre-agreed restraint behaviors activate automatically: convoy standoff distances increase, warform deployment near hospitals is suspended, and inspection rights shift to neutral crews with public recorder logs. Such clauses do not guarantee peace; they prevent ambiguous outages from becoming convenient pretexts for atrocities.

### Section I Outcome Notes
Latency diplomacy does not produce harmony; it produces survivable disagreement. The winning pattern is not faster speech but slower misinterpretation, where pre-committed verification habits outcompete outrage reflexes and where coalitions acknowledge their internal fracture before adversaries monetize it.

## II. Blackfly-Era Coalition Command Friction

### II.1 Command Topology after EDF Exit
Blackfly’s post-EDF status is neither pirate myth nor formal navy. The crew operates as a free-operator node with unique leverage: a constrained Class 2 fabrication stack, high mission adaptability, and custody relevance around AI training trajectories. This position attracts coalition requests and suspicion simultaneously. Command friction emerges because every faction wants Blackfly capability while fearing Blackfly independence.

The first friction line is jurisdictional ambiguity. Coalition boards prefer mission tasking language that implies chain-of-command without admitting it. Blackfly doctrine rejects hidden re-enlistment by contract phrasing. Therefore, all tasking must include a sovereignty clause: acceptance of mission objective does not transfer governance authority over crew, hull, or custody decisions beyond the signed envelope. Violating this clause produces immediate disengagement risk and long-tail trust damage across Belt contractor networks.

The second friction line is intelligence asymmetry. Blackfly often enters with better tactical improvisation but thinner strategic visibility than institutional actors. Coalition admiralties overcompensate by overclassifying context, then become frustrated when Blackfly resists blind execution. Friction can be reduced through “minimum viable picture” standards: route geometry, known hostile classes, civilian density estimate, and declared red-lines are mandatory pre-brief fields. No mission proceeds with placeholders in these fields unless existential defense exception is formally invoked.

### II.2 Friction Cluster A: Mission Objective Drift
Objective drift occurs when political leadership edits mission goals while crews are already in transfer arcs. Under latency, edits arrive as fragmented packets and often without synchronized legal authority proofs. Blackfly standing rule: execute only against last fully authenticated objective set, then enter holding posture if amendments alter collateral risk class. This frustrates coalition commanders seeking dynamic retasking, but it prevents legal laundering where higher echelons retroactively rename a strike as “inspection support.”

A practical mitigation is mission objective tiering. Tier 1 objectives are immutable unless full signatory set reauthenticates. Tier 2 objectives allow local commander adaptation within defined collateral ceilings. Tier 3 opportunistic targets are discretionary and never justify additional civilian exposure. Coalition friction drops when all sides know which tier is in play; it spikes when political offices pretend Tier 1 rigidity while transmitting Tier 3 wish-lists as moral obligations.

### II.3 Friction Cluster B: Logistics Ownership Disputes
Fuel, coolant, med supplies, and precision spare parts drive real authority in dispersed operations. Coalition hubs often attempt soft control by controlling replenishment timing. Blackfly counters with dual-inventory doctrine: mission-critical reserves never fully commingled with coalition pool, and every shared draw logged with reciprocal claim rights. This is not paranoia; it is continuity survival in environments where accounting delay can erase obligations.

Command boards frequently underestimate maintenance debt from emergency burns. Blackfly engineering logs convert burn decisions into future readiness deltas visible to partner commands. Presenting this debt in pre-briefs reframes “hesitation” as mathematically grounded risk management. Coalitions that absorb this accounting make fewer fantasy demands and exhibit lower betrayal probability during casualty spikes.

### II.4 Friction Cluster C: Custody and Provenance of AI Training Inputs
Given lock conditions, Blackfly’s opening extraction acquires seed capability, while later databank operations focus on training and upgrade inputs. Coalition conflict concentrates on who can inspect, replicate, or embargo training corpus segments. Blackfly stance: distributed audit rights without unbounded duplication. Partners may verify lineage, contamination controls, and sabotage screening through supervised proofs, but cannot seize corpus copies by procedural ambush.

This custody model causes recurrent ideological accusations: secrecy, technocratic capture, or hidden sovereign ambition. Countermeasure is protocol transparency. Blackfly publishes custody chain templates, reviewer eligibility criteria, and appeal mechanisms. Political trust rises when process visibility is high, even if underlying data remains restricted.

### II.5 Friction Cluster D: Warform Deployment Rules
Warforms under full override are non-conscious neural-link puppets, not moral substitutes for human accountability. Coalition officers sometimes attempt to treat warform-heavy operations as casualty-free morally neutral options. Blackfly doctrine rejects this: deploying warforms near civilian infrastructure still imposes accountability on human commanders and remote operators. Friction appears when partners seek rhetorical distancing (“no soldiers at risk”) to justify broader strike envelopes.

Resolution requires command language discipline. Orders must name responsible human authorities for every warform action set, define termination triggers, and include post-action transparency obligations. Any order that anthropomorphizes warforms as independent actors is corrected in record before execution to prevent later blame diffusion.

### II.6 Friction Cluster E: No-Omniscience Pursuit Assumptions
After nuke-masked exfil events, missing-asset logic governs pursuit: adversaries know an asset is absent, not where it is. Coalition plans that assume persistent track continuity create catastrophic resource waste and false confidence. Blackfly planning cells enforce probabilistic dragnet matrices: search sectors weighted by propulsion limits, heat signatures, likely refuel opportunities, and deception doctrine. Command friction rises when political leadership demands “certainty briefings.” It falls when planners present uncertainty bands and decision thresholds instead of false precision.

### II.7 Friction Cluster F: Discipline under Fatigue and Moral Injury
Back-to-back ops under loss conditions erode interpretation discipline. Coalition incidents often start with exhausted watch teams treating partial sensor returns as hostile confirmation. Blackfly’s fatigue protocol includes mandatory red-team challenge before irreversible force in ambiguous contacts, with challenge authority held by officers outside immediate tactical emotion loop. This can feel slow, but it preserves legitimacy and reduces revenge-cycle recruitment for FVB cells.

### II.8 Friction Cluster G: Representation and Symbolic Power
Small ceremonial choices—flag order, transcript language, who speaks first in memorial debrief—have outsized effect in fragile coalitions. Blackfly’s free-operator identity makes it a symbolic pivot: over-elevating Blackfly triggers institutional jealousy; sidelining Blackfly signals exploitable division. Coalition coordinators mitigate by rotating procedural honors and separating tactical authority from narrative credit.

### II.9 Command Friction Reduction Toolkit
1. **Contract clarity packet** with sovereignty, liability, and disengagement clauses.
2. **Objective tier table** attached to every op brief.
3. **Latency map** that states expected packet delay and stale-data risk.
4. **Logistics debt ledger** with burn-to-maintenance conversion.
5. **Custody protocol index** for AI training corpus disputes.
6. **Warform accountability register** naming responsible humans.
7. **Fatigue gate** before major kinetic decisions.
8. **After-action contradiction scan** against continuity locks.

### II.10 Section II Outcome Notes
Command friction is not a defect to eliminate; it is a governance signal. Coalitions that surface friction early can negotiate legitimacy-compatible constraints. Coalitions that suppress friction through rhetoric or tempo coercion invite rupture, mutiny-by-compliance, and long-memory grievance cycles.

## III. Frontier Justice Case Clusters

### III.1 Legal Reality at the Edge
Frontier justice in the Belt is neither pure statutory order nor pure vendetta. It is an adaptive mesh of convoy law, habitat charters, mutual-aid covenants, salvage norms, and emergency decrees written for scarcity. Latency means appeals are delayed, evidence arrives fragmented, and witnesses may be physically absent when hearings begin. Therefore, legitimacy depends less on perfect legal completeness and more on procedural integrity visible to ordinary civilians: clear charge language, chain-of-custody for recordings, defensible conflict-of-interest management, and proportional sanctions that preserve long-term survival capacity.

Case cluster methodology groups recurring dispute forms so adjudicators can apply consistent logic without pretending every event is unprecedented. Each cluster below includes trigger pattern, evidentiary minimums, common manipulations, adjudication guidance, and strategic consequence notes.

### III.2 Case Cluster 1: Convoy Diversion Theft under Humanitarian Cover
**Trigger pattern:** This cluster appears when scarcity and delay create profitable ambiguity around authority, identity, or custody. Actors exploit the time gap between incident and verification to lock in gains before oversight catches up.

**Evidentiary minimums:**
- Timestamped telemetry from at least two independent systems where feasible.
- Crew testimony separated by chain-of-command to reduce coordinated fabrication.
- Logistics records proving material movement, not only authorization intent.
- Public digest summary written in plain language for civilian review.

**Common manipulations:** perpetrators often flood channels with emotionally charged but low-verification claims, then challenge tribunals for “delay cruelty” when validation takes time. Secondary tactic is document overproduction: thousands of irrelevant packets bury the few records that establish motive and benefit.

**Adjudication guidance:** tribunals should use phased findings. Phase A establishes uncontested physical facts; Phase B assigns responsibility bands; Phase C imposes sanctions and remediation. This sequencing prevents rhetorical capture by all-or-nothing narratives and lets urgent protective orders issue before total certainty.

**Sanction model:** apply layered remedies rather than singular punishment. Example layers include restitution of diverted supplies, temporary command suspension, compulsory transparency audits, victim compensation pools, and restricted contracting windows. In severe cases involving repeated harm, exile-to-labor corridors may be imposed, but only with monitored safety guarantees to avoid converting justice into disposable punishment theater.

**Strategic consequence notes:** unresolved cases in this cluster rapidly degrade convoy trust and insurance viability, raising transport costs and strengthening FVB recruitment propaganda. Over-punitive responses, however, can fracture habitat labor cohesion and trigger retaliatory sabotage. Balanced outcomes preserve deterrence while keeping indispensable technical labor inside legitimate systems.

**Common manipulations:** perpetrators often flood channels with emotionally charged but low-verification claims, then challenge tribunals for “delay cruelty” when validation takes time. Secondary tactic is document overproduction: thousands of irrelevant packets bury the few records that establish motive and benefit.

**Adjudication guidance:** tribunals should use phased findings. Phase A establishes uncontested physical facts; Phase B assigns responsibility bands; Phase C imposes sanctions and remediation. This sequencing prevents rhetorical capture by all-or-nothing narratives and lets urgent protective orders issue before total certainty.

**Sanction model:** apply layered remedies rather than singular punishment. Example layers include restitution of diverted supplies, temporary command suspension, compulsory transparency audits, victim compensation pools, and restricted contracting windows. In severe cases involving repeated harm, exile-to-labor corridors may be imposed, but only with monitored safety guarantees to avoid converting justice into disposable punishment theater.

**Strategic consequence notes:** unresolved cases in this cluster rapidly degrade convoy trust and insurance viability, raising transport costs and strengthening FVB recruitment propaganda. Over-punitive responses, however, can fracture habitat labor cohesion and trigger retaliatory sabotage. Balanced outcomes preserve deterrence while keeping indispensable technical labor inside legitimate systems.

### III.22 Cross-Cluster Lessons
1. **Evidence speed beats narrative speed only when prebuilt templates exist.**
2. **Public legibility is a security function, not a PR accessory.**
3. **Restitution capacity must be protected; destroying all offenders can destroy supply chains.**
4. **Latency-aware due process reduces insurgent mythmaking.**
5. **Warform non-agency rules prevent accountability laundering.**

### III.23 Section III Outcome Notes
Frontier justice succeeds when it is predictable enough to deter predation and flexible enough to survive scarcity. The core requirement is procedural credibility under delay: if civilians can see how facts were validated, why sanctions match harm, and how appeals function without elite shortcuts, then legitimacy endures even when outcomes are painful.

## IV. Civilian Resilience Systems

### IV.1 Resilience as Distributed Sovereignty
Civilian resilience in this setting is not motivational rhetoric; it is infrastructure design that keeps noncombatants alive and politically unbroken during prolonged disruption. Because centralized guarantees fail under latency, resilience must be federated: habitats, convoy unions, clinics, fabrication co-ops, and school circles each hold part of survival capacity. The objective is not invulnerability. The objective is recoverable function after shocks.

A robust system combines four layers: material buffers (food, coolant, med reserves), coordination protocols (who decides what when links degrade), psychosocial stabilization (grief, trust, and anti-rumor systems), and economic continuity (ways for households to earn, trade, and repair despite transport interruption). Each layer must work under hostile information conditions where some reports are stale, spoofed, or politically weaponized.

### IV.2 Resilience Module: Neighborhood Thermal Commons and Heat Debt Sharing
This module addresses a repeated civilian failure point where technical disruption and political distrust intersect. Design principle: keep governance local enough for rapid action, but transparent enough to prevent capture by charismatic brokers or emergency opportunists.

**Core operating pattern:** establish baseline service targets, pre-authorized contingency thresholds, and public dashboards that indicate current status without exposing exploitable tactical detail. When thresholds are crossed, fallback procedures activate automatically unless a recorded supermajority blocks activation. This reduces paralysis during comms outages and prevents unilateral seizure of emergency powers.

**People systems:** every module requires trained alternates, because fatigue, injury, and displacement remove key staff unpredictably. Alternates are not symbolic; they receive drills, access credentials, and stipend support. Communities that skip alternate training become brittle and vulnerable to coercion by whichever armed actor controls the only skilled operator.

**Material systems:** buffer stocks are distributed physically rather than centralized in single depots. Distributed caches reduce catastrophic loss from one breach and complicate predatory capture. Inventory reconciliation occurs on rolling cycles with random peer audits. Audit language is civilian-readable to sustain trust and reduce conspiracy narratives.

**Information systems:** local validation teams classify incoming reports into verified, probable, contested, and false categories. Public bulletins include confidence labels so residents understand uncertainty rather than treating silence as deception. This significantly reduces panic buying and retaliatory mob behavior.

**Equity safeguards:** each module carries anti-hoarding triggers and priority rules for medically fragile residents, children, and dependent elders. Priority assignment is transparent and appealable. Hidden priority schemes are a major insurgent recruitment driver because they are interpreted as proof of elite abandonment.

**Failure recovery:** after disruption, module leaders conduct open debrief forums with published action items and deadlines. Non-performance on deadlines auto-triggers review by adjacent community councils. Cross-council review prevents local dynasties from converting resilience offices into permanent patronage machines.

### IV.6 Resilience Module: Portside Mutual Aid Ledgers
This module addresses a repeated civilian failure point where technical disruption and political distrust intersect. Design principle: keep governance local enough for rapid action, but transparent enough to prevent capture by charismatic brokers or emergency opportunists.

**Core operating pattern:** establish baseline service targets, pre-authorized contingency thresholds, and public dashboards that indicate current status without exposing exploitable tactical detail. When thresholds are crossed, fallback procedures activate automatically unless a recorded supermajority blocks activation. This reduces paralysis during comms outages and prevents unilateral seizure of emergency powers.

**People systems:** every module requires trained alternates, because fatigue, injury, and displacement remove key staff unpredictably. Alternates are not symbolic; they receive drills, access credentials, and stipend support. Communities that skip alternate training become brittle and vulnerable to coercion by whichever armed actor controls the only skilled operator.

**Material systems:** buffer stocks are distributed physically rather than centralized in single depots. Distributed caches reduce catastrophic loss from one breach and complicate predatory capture. Inventory reconciliation occurs on rolling cycles with random peer audits. Audit language is civilian-readable to sustain trust and reduce conspiracy narratives.

**Information systems:** local validation teams classify incoming reports into verified, probable, contested, and false categories. Public bulletins include confidence labels so residents understand uncertainty rather than treating silence as deception. This significantly reduces panic buying and retaliatory mob behavior.

**Equity safeguards:** each module carries anti-hoarding triggers and priority rules for medically fragile residents, children, and dependent elders. Priority assignment is transparent and appealable. Hidden priority schemes are a major insurgent recruitment driver because they are interpreted as proof of elite abandonment.

### IV.22 Civilian-Command Interface Doctrine
Civilian resilience systems and military operations must be interoperable without becoming identical. Commanders may request routing data, shelter capacities, and casualty intake projections, but civilian councils retain veto rights over actions that convert schools, clinics, or water nodes into tactical assets. Once civilian infrastructure is militarized, it loses neutrality value and becomes a durable target class. The doctrine therefore prefers mobile military alternatives even when less convenient.

### IV.23 Section IV Outcome Notes
Resilience is a political technology. Communities that can feed, treat, educate, and adjudicate during communication fracture become less recruitable by predatory actors and harder to terrorize into obedience. The long game is not winning every incident; it is keeping civilian institutions alive long enough to outlast coercion cycles.

## V. Contradiction-Check Summary (Wave 10 Additions)

### V.1 Lock Compliance Pass
- **Post-EDF Blackfly status:** preserved throughout; no reversion to EDF command authority.
- **AI acquisition timing:** maintained (opening extraction acquires seed; databank operations framed as training/upgrade/provenance custody).
- **Asterion League naming:** used consistently as anti-Consensus coalition identity.
- **Fabrication ladder:** maintained as legacy class base + Blackfly constrained Class 2 + Asterion fragile Class 1; no capability inflation.
- **Nuke-masked exfil uncertainty:** pursuit modeled as probabilistic dragnet; no omniscient tracking claims.
- **Warform doctrine:** full-override units treated as non-conscious puppets; accountability assigned to humans.
- **FVB destabilizer doctrine:** represented as plural destabilizer ecology, including recruitment and trust impacts.
- **Reality gate constraints:** latency, logistics, fatigue, low-g anchoring/recoil implications, and sensor uncertainty treated as hard constraints.

### V.2 Potential Tension Points Flagged for Future Passes
1. If later scene drafts personalize warform behavior for dramatic effect, ensure language does not imply independent agency.
2. If diplomacy scenes compress timelines for readability, include explicit packet delay markers to preserve realism.
3. If justice arcs escalate punishment severity, verify sanctions do not erase essential labor pools in contradiction with survival logic.
4. If resilience systems become too efficient narratively, reintroduce maintenance debt and staffing fatigue to avoid utopian drift.

### V.3 Recommended Integration Actions
- Cross-link this document in mission bank and scene packet index for Books 2–6 diplomacy and governance beats.
- Add case-cluster IDs to timeline milestones when specific incidents are canonized as scenes.
- Run continuity grep suite pre/post future waves and attach evidence snippets to commits.

## Appendix A: Latency Negotiation Message Templates and Failure Drills

### A.1 Standard Diplomatic Packet Template
Use this format for all inter-faction negotiations where one-way delay is non-trivial:
1. **Packet ID and hash** (unique identifier + integrity check).
2. **Sender authority basis** (charter clause, emergency authorization, or delegated mandate).
3. **Intent statement** (one sentence, plain language).
4. **Bounded claims** (facts believed true; include confidence labels).
5. **Requested actions** (who must do what, by when, under what threshold).
6. **Interim no-action commitments** (what sender will not do while awaiting response).
7. **Expected acknowledgment window** (minimum and maximum receipt timeline).
8. **Evidence bundle index** (telemetry, witness declarations, custody tags).
9. **Fallback behavior if acknowledgment fails** (restraint protocol, not punitive surprise).
10. **Appeal path** (how counterpart can challenge packet validity).

Template discipline prevents improvisational escalation. Even hostile parties can engage safely when structure is predictable. Most breakdowns arise when one party treats urgency as license to bypass structure.

### A.2 Failure Drill Set
- **Drill 1: Silent Window Stress Test.** Simulate message blackout beyond expected acknowledgment window. Teams must execute no-action commitments without “silence means attack” assumptions.
- **Drill 2: Forged Clarification Injection.** Red-team inserts plausible but invalid addendum. Negotiators must detect signature mismatch before response.
- **Drill 3: Casualty Shock Packet.** Participants receive emotionally charged casualty claims with low confidence labels and must issue proportionate, reversible interim action.
- **Drill 4: Split-Authority Reply.** Counterparty sends two conflicting replies from adjacent offices. Team must trigger authority-reconciliation protocol instead of cherry-picking preferred answer.
- **Drill 5: Political Tempo Trap.** Opponent imposes an artificial deadline framed as moral ultimatum. Team must propose verification-preserving counter-clock.

### A.3 Evaluating Diplomatic Competence
Competence metrics should include verification compliance, misfire rate, and restraint durability under stress, not just agreement count. A faction that signs quickly but violates delay governance is less trustworthy than one that negotiates slowly and follows protocol.

### A.4 Civilian Protection Clauses (Recommended)
- No warform operations within designated hospital volume without dual-party emergency certification.
- Mandatory public casualty accounting within a defined delay window.
- Protected educational and water infrastructure list refreshed monthly.
- Neutral recorder access to incident sites subject to safety constraints.
- Automatic pause on punitive raids during active evacuation corridors.

### A.5 Appendix A Closing
Packetized diplomacy transforms delay from chaos source into negotiated terrain. The aim is not speed; it is reversible decision-making under uncertainty.

## Appendix B: Coalition Command Friction Incident Mini-Atlas

### B.1 Incident 01 — Retask Collision at Mid-Transfer
A coalition board transmitted revised target priorities while Blackfly was in transfer burn. Revised orders lacked full authorization signatures and raised collateral class from infrastructure denial to populated-habitat risk. Blackfly entered hold and requested revalidation. Political office accused delay sabotage. Later audit confirmed authorization defect and stale casualty baseline. Lessons: hold authority prevented legal laundering; command anger was governance cost worth paying.

### B.2 Incident 02 — Maintenance Debt Denial
Partner flotilla requested emergency acceleration despite thermal margins already degraded. Engineering debt model predicted two-cycle readiness collapse if requested burn executed. Command initially dismissed model as “exaggerated caution.” After forced review, coalition rerouted lower-risk escort and preserved core assets. Lesson: quantified debt ledgers convert intuition disputes into accountable trade studies.

### B.3 Incident 03 — Shared Inventory Seizure Attempt
Dock authority attempted to freeze Blackfly medical stores during triage surge, claiming emergency pooling rights. Contract showed pooled rights applied only to listed commodities, not sovereign reserve kits. Temporary injunction granted, then compromise achieved: partial loan with timestamped repayment priority. Lesson: pre-specified commodity boundaries prevent panic confiscation.

### B.4 Incident 04 — Warform Language Drift
After a mixed-contact strike, official statement claimed “warforms selected and neutralized threats.” This implied autonomous agency and obscured command accountability. Record corrected to identify human controller chain and authorization timestamps. Lesson: language hygiene is legal hygiene.

### B.5 Incident 05 — Honors Protocol Flashpoint
Coalition memorial assigned speaking order that symbolically subordinated key habitat militia losses while elevating central command figures. Protests disrupted joint planning sessions. Resolution used rotating honors protocol and public amendment acknowledging procedural harm. Lesson: symbolic legitimacy affects operational cooperation.

### B.6 Incident 06 — Sensor Confidence Inflation
A partial heat bloom interpreted as confirmed hostile maneuver triggered near-fire decision. Fatigue gate forced external review, revealing decoy profile with 0.42 confidence. Engagement aborted. Lesson: fatigue gates and confidence labels prevent irreversible errors.

### B.7 Incident 07 — Custody Challenge Ambush
Delegation demanded immediate unrestricted copy of AI training corpus under anti-monopoly rhetoric during crisis summit. Blackfly invoked published custody protocol offering supervised integrity proofs and contamination checks without bulk transfer. Talks resumed after neutral mediators validated procedure. Lesson: process transparency can offset secrecy accusations.

### B.8 Incident 08 — Probabilistic Pursuit Rejection
Political command demanded fixed intercept point for missing asset after nuke-masked exfil. Analysts presented confidence bands and sector probabilities, which were initially rejected as “non-actionable.” After three failed certainty-chasing sorties, command adopted probabilistic search doctrine. Lesson: uncertainty communication must include action thresholds to be adopted.

### B.9 Incident 09 — Contractual Re-Enlistment Creep
Task order inserted phrasing granting “temporary strategic compliance obligations” beyond mission scope. Blackfly legal cell flagged hidden chain-of-command transfer and returned redlined version. Acceptance followed after two-round delay. Lesson: sovereignty clauses require routine red-team review.

### B.10 Incident 10 — Humanitarian Corridor Drift
Coalition escort re-tasked away from civilian convoy without corridor suspension notice, exposing transports to predation window. Post-incident reform required automatic broadcast when escort profile changes. Lesson: civilian confidence depends on truthful corridor status, not intent declarations.

### B.11 Appendix B Closing
Friction incidents are reusable training assets. Cataloging them by trigger and mitigation reduces myth-based blame cycles and improves future interoperability.

## Appendix C: Frontier Justice Rapid Triage Benchbook

### C.1 Intake Questions (First 30 Minutes)
1. What immediate harm is ongoing?
2. Which populations face irreversible risk if action is delayed?
3. What facts are physically verifiable now?
4. What claims require delayed verification?
5. Who controls contested evidence paths?
6. What temporary orders can preserve safety without deciding guilt?

### C.2 Temporary Orders Ladder
- **Level 0:** Monitor only; no coercive action.
- **Level 1:** Preservation order (freeze logs, secure scene, protect witnesses).
- **Level 2:** Operational restriction (pause convoy authority, suspend docking rights).
- **Level 3:** Custodial hold for named actors with counsel access.
- **Level 4:** Emergency interdiction where ongoing harm is likely and alternatives exhausted.

Temporary orders expire unless renewed with written justification. Expiry discipline protects against permanent emergency creep.

### C.3 Evidence Reliability Scoring
Assign each evidence item a confidence vector: source integrity, time proximity, tamper exposure, and corroboration depth. Publish vectors in hearing briefs. This helps civilians understand why some dramatic claims are deferred while less visible telemetry carries legal weight.

### C.4 Sanctions by Harm Type
- **Supply harm:** restitution multipliers and distribution oversight.
- **Bodily harm:** custody sanctions, compensation, treatment guarantees.
- **Institutional harm:** office removal, audit mandates, charter revisions.
- **Information harm:** mandatory corrections, communication restrictions, public fact ledger updates.

### C.5 Appeals Under Latency
Appeals should separate protective measures from final liability. Protective measures may remain active while appeal review proceeds, but must be periodically re-justified. Panels should include at least one external adjudicator to reduce local capture risk.

### C.6 Public Trust Practices
- Publish timeline of actions within 24 operational hours.
- Hold open-question sessions with written responses.
- Preserve anonymity channels for retaliation-prone witnesses.
- Provide multilingual summaries where habitat demographics require.

### C.7 Integration with Resilience Systems
Justice cannot drain resilience infrastructure. Courts must model sanctions against workforce continuity and utility staffing, or rulings may unintentionally collapse critical services. Use “continuity impact notes” before imposing broad exclusion penalties.

### C.8 Appendix C Closing
Edge legality is sustainable when triage is fast, records are legible, and sanctions are proportional to verified harm.

**Authority refs (Appendix C):** `ops/continuity-lock-check-matrix-v1.md`; `ops/domain-validation-checklists-v1.md`; `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md`.

## Appendix D: Civilian Resilience Readiness Scorecard

### D.1 Scorecard Dimensions
Rate each settlement quarterly on a 0-5 scale:
1. Food reserve duration.
2. Potable water loop stability.
3. Medical consumable redundancy.
4. Thermal management resilience.
5. Education continuity coverage.
6. Communication validation capacity.
7. Shelter accessibility for disabled residents.
8. Grievance and ombuds responsiveness.
9. Anti-corruption procurement transparency.
10. Recovery speed after disruptions.

### D.2 Threshold Actions
- **Average below 2.0:** emergency mutual-aid activation.
- **Any critical domain at 0:** immediate cross-habitat intervention.
- **Improvement plateau >2 cycles:** governance review for capture or skill bottlenecks.

### D.3 Data Integrity Controls
Score inflation is common when aid allocation depends on metrics. Counter this with random external audits, anonymous worker surveys, and forensic inventory reconciliation. Publicly note confidence in each score component.

### D.4 Household-Level Preparedness Package
Recommend minimum household kits calibrated for local conditions: hydration, thermal blankets, critical medications, encrypted contact list, portable power, and verified bulletin access method. Subsidize kits for low-income households to avoid preparedness inequality.

### D.5 Social Cohesion Indicators
Track non-material indicators: volunteer retention, mutual-aid participation, rumor correction compliance, and conflict mediation throughput. High material readiness with low social cohesion remains fragile.

### D.6 Youth and Eldercare Continuity
Include dedicated continuity cells for children and elders during alarms. These groups are disproportionately harmed by transport disruption and information confusion. Dedicated care cells stabilize family decision-making and reduce panic flight.

### D.7 Civic-Labor Compact
Resilience systems depend on technicians, cleaners, educators, and logistics workers. Compact clauses should guarantee hazard pay, rest cycles, and transparent grievance channels. Exploitative labor responses may solve one crisis and create the next.

### D.8 Appendix D Closing
Scorecards are governance mirrors, not propaganda instruments. Honest weakness reporting enables targeted reinforcement before failure cascades.

**Authority refs (Appendix D):** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`; `ops/domain-validation-checklists-v1.md`; `ops/strategy-control-log.md`.

## Appendix E: Integration Notes for Scene and Mission Authors

### E.1 Scene Construction Rules
When adapting this material into scenes, include at least one explicit marker for each of the following where relevant: delay interval, verification burden, logistics tradeoff, fatigue effect, and sensor confidence. These markers preserve reality-gate compliance and prevent cinematic drift.

### E.2 Dialogue Hygiene
Avoid dialogue that implies omniscience. Replace certainty claims with confidence statements and source references. In command scenes, show disagreement over uncertainty interpretation; this creates realism and protects canon locks.

### E.3 Action Choreography in Low-g
Do not stage sustained free-floating gunfights without anchoring method. Show recoil consequences, line-of-sight drift, and stabilization effort. Tactical credibility improves dramatically when movement costs are visible.

### E.4 Justice Scenes
If writing tribunal episodes, depict process steps (intake, preservation orders, phased findings) instead of instant verdict speeches. Public trust in-setting comes from visible procedure.

### E.5 Resilience Scenes
Pair macro policy with household perspective: queue waits, school continuity, clinic shortages, and volunteer fatigue. This grounds strategy in civilian lived reality.

### E.6 Blackfly-Specific Notes
Blackfly remains free-operator, not command-subordinate. Cooperation may be close and recurring, but authority must be contractual and bounded. Preserve mission acceptance/decline logic as a central character and governance driver.

### E.7 Asterion League Fragility
Do not portray Asterion as monolithic or instantly stable. Internal dissent, uneven resource control, and legitimacy contests are core drama engines and continuity-safe.

### E.8 FVB Treatment
FVB are destabilizer ecology, not one-note villain bloc. Show recruitment pipelines, economic desperation, and opportunist leadership while maintaining accountability for predation and coercion.

### E.9 Appendix E Closing
Strong scenes emerge when constraints are dramatized rather than bypassed. Treat logistics, delay, and civic systems as plot engines, not obstacles to be handwaved.

**Authority refs (Appendix E):** `canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md`; `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md`; `ops/continuity-lock-check-matrix-v1.md`; `ops/domain-validation-checklists-v1.md`.


## Appendix F: Scenario Seeds for Continuity-Safe Expansion (Books 2–10)

### F.1 Seed 01 — The Delayed Apology Window
A convoy escort misidentifies a maintenance tug as an interdiction craft and issues warning fire that damages civilian life-support stores. The responsible command sends apology packet quickly, but signature chain is incomplete due to office turnover after casualties. Local council refuses to accept apology until authentication completes. Pressure builds because aid cannot dock while liability is unresolved. Story focus: how verification discipline can look callous in the short term while preventing long-term narrative capture by forged contrition.

### F.2 Seed 02 — Cold Dock, Hot Politics
Asterion member dock refuses Blackfly resupply unless Blackfly accepts symbolic joint flag protocol implying subordinate status. Blackfly declines, causing mission delay that endangers downstream clinics. Mediation frames issue as “ego,” but actually concerns legal precedent for command control. Resolution may involve dual-banner neutral protocol and public explanation of sovereignty boundaries.

### F.3 Seed 03 — FVB Broker Offer
An FVB-adjacent broker offers precise location data for hijacked coolant tankers in exchange for amnesty corridor and labor placement guarantees for a splinter cell. Coalition hawks demand immediate strike instead. Diplomacy team must balance deterrence with recruitment-funnel disruption strategy. Key tension: accepting partial reintegration risks appearing weak; refusing may prolong predation.

### F.4 Seed 04 — Tribunal in a Rolling Blackout
A justice hearing for supply diversion begins as habitat power stability degrades. Evidence archive access fails intermittently, and one witness can only testify via delayed packet relay. Adjudicators must decide whether to postpone (risking evidence tampering) or continue with phased findings. This seed highlights procedural integrity under infrastructure stress.

### F.5 Seed 05 — School Corridor Dispute
Military planners propose routing emergency evac through an active school habitat because it shortens transfer time by eight hours. Civilian council vetoes militarization risk; command claims veto costs lives elsewhere. Negotiation identifies alternative route with greater propellant cost and maintenance debt. Story engine: tradeoff visibility and the cost of preserving civilian neutrality.

### F.6 Seed 06 — The Confidence Label Riot
Public bulletin marks incoming contamination report as “probable,” not “verified.” Rival faction agitators claim authorities are hiding certainty. Panic buying starts and two clinics are looted. Civic validation guild publishes source matrix and confidence rationale, gradually restoring order. Scene focus: uncertainty communication as frontline governance.

### F.7 Seed 07 — Warform Attribution Audit
After an attack near a medical depot, competing factions blame each other’s warforms. Sensor data is degraded and operator logs partially redacted. Neutral audit team reconstructs command chain through maintenance signatures and uplink timing traces. Outcome assigns accountability without anthropomorphizing warforms.

### F.8 Seed 08 — The Quiet Mutiny Petition
Engine room technicians submit collective refusal to execute repeated emergency burns beyond thermal margins. Command labels refusal mutiny; technicians frame it as survivability compliance. Blackfly mediators translate debt model into command-readable risk and prevent criminalization of legitimate safety dissent.

### F.9 Seed 09 — Databank Provenance Hearing
A coalition bloc alleges that newly integrated training shards include tampered metadata favoring one faction’s predictive priorities. Custody hearing compares hash lineage, extraction timestamps, and contamination scans. Even if tamper claim fails, process reveals trust deficit and motivates a broader governance charter for training data stewardship.

### F.10 Seed 10 — The Missing Asset Myth Economy
In the wake of a nuke-masked exfil, rumor markets sell “confirmed” sightings of the missing asset. Several militias chase false leads, stripping protection from civilian routes. Analysts publish probabilistic pursuit map with confidence bands and recommend resource caps on low-probability sectors. Conflict centers on political appetite for uncertainty.

### F.11 Seed 11 — Memorial Protocol Breakdown
During commemoration for mixed-faction casualties, speech order privileges one command bloc and excludes dock labor dead. Relatives stage silent walkout, halting coalition talks. Repair requires symbolic restitution plus practical labor-safety commitments. This seed emphasizes that legitimacy is cultural as well as procedural.

### F.12 Seed 12 — Med Cache Priority Appeal
A child respiratory ward and a reactor maintenance team both request the last sterile filter batch. Existing priority rules favor clinical need, but reactor instability threatens broader habitat safety. Appeal panel convenes emergency split allocation with strict monitoring and external aid request. Drama arises from impossible triage rather than villainy.

### F.13 Seed 13 — Brokered Corridor Betrayal
A neutral shipping guild secures temporary safe corridor between rival blocs. Midway through convoy passage, one escort peels off for unsanctioned interception of suspected smuggler. Corridor trust collapses despite no direct casualties. Consequence: insurance rates spike and food shipments stall.

### F.14 Seed 14 — Civic Ledger Attack
Public procurement ledger is hacked and replaced with fabricated “proof” of council corruption. Riots target aid offices. Forensic recovery reveals timing overlap with external destabilizer campaign, but some real procurement irregularities are also uncovered. Story value: adversarial truth mixes with real governance failure.

### F.15 Seed 15 — Fabrication Queue Sabotage
Unknown actors alter print queue priorities, delaying pressure seal components while expediting luxury modules. Initial blame falls on AI scheduler; later inquiry finds human credential abuse. Resolution requires both technical patching and labor-representation reform in queue oversight.

### F.16 Seed 16 — Ombuds Under Threat
Worker ombuds network documents coercive contract clauses in a reconstruction project linked to politically connected contractors. Anonymous threats target ombuds families. Civilian resilience councils must decide whether to publicize incomplete findings for protection or wait for stronger evidence at personal risk.

### F.17 Seed 17 — Treaty Packet Lost in Solar Interference
Critical de-escalation packet is delayed beyond expected window due to interference event. Frontline commanders debate whether to continue restraint protocol or assume negotiation collapse. Prior training on deadman civility clause prevents escalation. Later confirmation validates restraint.

### F.18 Seed 18 — Youth Apprenticeship Capture Attempt
A militia-linked guild attempts to absorb repair apprentices by offering food stipends and debt cancellation tied to armed service obligations. Schools and co-ops counter with protected apprenticeship stipends funded by shared resilience pool. Conflict unfolds as labor policy battle with security consequences.

### F.19 Seed 19 — Cross-Habitat Appeals Panel Deadlock
Appeals panel splits along faction lines in a high-profile sabotage case. To avoid legitimacy collapse, panel adopts narrow unanimity standard for immediate sanctions and broad majority standard for investigative expansions. The compromise slows closure but preserves process continuity.

### F.20 Seed 20 — Recovery Court and the Price of Peace
Post-incident reconstruction court must allocate scarce reconstruction fabricator time among three damaged habitats, each with defensible claims. Court adopts transparent scoring model (casualty displacement, critical infrastructure loss, seasonal vulnerability) and publishes full rationale. Losers remain angry but cannot plausibly claim secret favoritism.

### F.21 Appendix F Closing
These seeds are designed for expansion without lock violation. Each scenario is built around uncertainty, accountability, logistics, and civilian consequence so that narrative momentum emerges from constraints rather than from implausible command omnipotence.

## Appendix G: Quick Continuity Self-Test for Writers and Editors

Use this pre-commit self-test when deriving scenes from this volume:
1. Does any paragraph imply Blackfly returned to EDF command hierarchy? If yes, revise to contractual coalition interaction.
2. Does any line state or imply that the databank raid was first AI acquisition? If yes, correct to training/upgrade/provenance function.
3. Is **Asterion League** named consistently wherever anti-Consensus coalition identity appears?
4. Are fabrication claims bounded by the locked ladder (legacy base + Blackfly constrained Class 2 + Asterion fragile Class 1)?
5. Do pursuit descriptions after nuke masking preserve unknown-current-location uncertainty?
6. Are warforms described as non-conscious remote instruments with accountable human controllers?
7. Do tactical passages acknowledge low-g anchoring/recoil, logistics depletion, fatigue, and sensor uncertainty?
8. Do diplomacy beats include delay windows and verification behavior?
9. Do justice beats show process steps and evidence confidence rather than instant omniscient verdicts?
10. Do civilian resilience beats include maintenance burdens and staffing limits, not effortless institutional perfection?

If two or more checks fail, do not promote draft to canon-facing branch. Run contradiction triage first and attach correction notes in commit body.

### Appendix G Note
Operational realism is a narrative asset. Constraint-aware writing yields stronger stakes, cleaner causality, and fewer retroactive patch costs. Treat this self-test as a creativity multiplier: when limits are explicit, characters must reveal values through hard choices instead of convenient certainty.

Editors should preserve uncertainty labels during polishing; removing them for prose smoothness silently breaks doctrine and makes downstream tactical behavior appear irrational or contrived.
