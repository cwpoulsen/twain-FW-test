# Wave 10 Expansion: Latency Diplomacy, Coalition Friction, Frontier Justice, and Civilian Resilience (v1, Reconciled)

## CANON LOCK HEADER (mandatory)
- Canonical actors: Steward Directorate, Consensus Operations Complex, Earth Defense Fleet (EDF), Belt Municipal Compacts, Asterion League.
- Blackfly is post-EDF free-operator; opening extraction acquires AI seed/system, databank raid supplies training/upgrade inputs.
- Fabrication ladder lock: Class 4/3/2/1; Blackfly constrained Class 2, Asterion League fragile Class 1.
- Nuke-masked exfil lock: missing-asset probabilistic dragnet, no omniscient tracking.
- Warform lock: fully overridden units are non-conscious instruments; human command accountability required.
- FVB destabilizer doctrine active.
- Reality Gate constraints active (low-g anchoring/recoil, heat/propulsion/logistics/fatigue/sensor uncertainty).

## Scope and Intent
Bible-grade operating framework for four domains: diplomacy under latency, coalition command friction, frontier justice clusters, civilian resilience systems.

## I. Inter-Faction Diplomacy Under Latency
### I.1 Diplomatic Physics
Latency is political: intent, receipt, and retrospective narrative diverge under delay and scarcity.

### I.2 Latency-Native Treaty Architecture
Use packetized negotiation objects (intent, bounded claims, evidence hashes, expected ack interval, outage behavior).

### I.3 Authentication and Custody Protocols
Checksum-first response discipline; chain-of-custody proof outranks rhetorical urgency.

### I.4 Coalition Signaling under Sensor Uncertainty
Publish uncertainty bands and no-action windows; prohibit silence-as-hostility shortcuts.

### I.5 Asterion Internal Mediation Loops
Attach dissent maps to outbound positions to reduce reversal shock across sub-factions.

### I.6 Earth-Side Negotiation Counterplay
Resist tempo-capture tactics by negotiating clock terms explicitly.

### I.7 Blackfly as Shadow Broker without Sovereign Seat
Blackfly can broker de-escalation packets without inheriting bloc sovereignty.

### I.8 Crisis Corridors and Humanitarian Deconfliction
Deadman civility clauses auto-activate restraint behavior during comms breaks.

### I.9 Failure Modes and Salvage Patterns
Prioritize re-verification, interim restraint, and public correction over rhetorical certainty.

## II. Blackfly-Era Coalition Command Friction
### II.1- II.10 Summary
- Contract sovereignty clauses prevent hidden re-enlistment.
- Objective tiering limits mission-drift laundering.
- Logistics debt ledgers expose readiness costs of emergency burns.
- AI training-input custody allows audit rights without corpus seizure.
- Warform orders must name accountable humans.
- Pursuit planning uses probabilistic dragnet math, not certainty theater.
- Fatigue gates and red-team challenge reduce revenge-cycle errors.
- Symbolic protocol (credit/order/speaking rights) treated as coalition stability variable.

## III. Frontier Justice Case Clusters (Reconciled)
Applied template across recurring incident classes:
- Trigger pattern
- Evidentiary minimums
- Common manipulations
- Adjudication phases
- Layered sanction model
- Strategic consequence notes

Cluster set:
1. Convoy diversion theft under humanitarian cover
2. Spoofed distress-beacon ambushes
3. Unauthorized dock seizure by auxiliaries
4. Fuel adulteration in shared refill chains
5. Contract kidnapping via debt-arbitration abuse
6. Medical ration hoarding by office holders
7. Counterfeit authentication keys in treaty traffic
8. Salvage-rights fraud after debris engagements

## IV. Civilian Resilience Systems
- Rights-clocked aid governance with transparent triage criteria.
- Shelter, schooling, care, and labor protections remain linked but non-coercive.
- Resilience metrics include compensation completion, trust stability, repeat-harm reduction.
- Governance design emphasizes reversibility, auditability, and localized legitimacy.

## V. Contradiction-Check Summary (Wave 10 Additions)
- No real-time Earth command assumptions.
- No Consensus monopoly reversion.
- No Blackfly omnipotence drift.
- No warform personhood slippage.
- No zero-cost victory language; costs tracked in logistics/legitimacy domains.

## Appendix A-G (Reconciled)
Appendices retained as authoring aids; redundant boilerplate removed. Use existing mission/scene/timeline authorities for packet instantiation and evidence linkage.
