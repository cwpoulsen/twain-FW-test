# Postwar Justice Implementation Failures and Repair Framework — Series Expansion Wave 18 v1

Status: continuity-safe series architecture addendum.
Scope: justice rollout failures after reconquest and dramatic utility for Books 5–10.


## Continuity Lock Header
- Canonical actors only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.
- Constraint posture: no miracle throughput, no real-time cross-theater command beyond latency envelopes, no zero-cost victories.
- Conflict cadence: mechanism -> decision -> cost; preserve accountability and auditability trails.

## 1) Why Justice Fails After Military Success
Evidence rot in port recovery boards is treated as a constrained administrative mechanism rather than a slogan. Operational planners model queue age, labor fatigue, materials loss, and decision latency before issuing directives, because each instruction travels through imperfect registries and contested intermediaries. In practice, field teams are forced to choose between imperfect options: preserve procedural purity and lose tempo, or accelerate action and accept downstream appeals debt. The doctrine preference is explicit trade disclosure: officers must record what was delayed, who absorbed the burden, and which review gate will revisit the decision. This keeps governance legible under stress and prevents silent conversion of emergency habits into permanent rule. When compliance weakens, response begins with service reliability repair and evidentiary transparency, not immediate force escalation, unless there is imminent lethal risk. Every cycle ends with a public-facing update that ties resource constraints to concrete next actions, so legitimacy is built by truthful cadence rather than optimistic propaganda.

Witness fear in mobile adjudication teams is treated as a constrained administrative mechanism rather than a slogan.
