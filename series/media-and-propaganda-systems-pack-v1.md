# Stewards of Progress — Media + Propaganda Systems Pack v1

Status: **SOFT-CANON narrative-control architecture**  
Scope: Earth broadcast stack, Consensus content operations, Belt counter-media ecology  
Goal: make information war concrete, procedural, and economically grounded.

---

## 1) Information Is a Utility, Not a Marketplace

Consensus-era Earth treats media as civic infrastructure like water and transport. The public receives content through reliability channels, not adversarial platforms.

### Immediate consequence
Misinformation drops, but so does epistemic competition. Citizens lose practice in evaluating contested truth claims.

---

## 2) Earth Media Stack (Four Tiers)

## Tier 1 — Civic Broadcast Grid (CBG)
- Universal baseline feed in public spaces, transit, workplaces.
- Mix of weather/logistics alerts, policy explainers, and normalization narratives.
- High trust due to consistent factual micro-content (transport times, supply updates).

**Control insight:** high factual reliability in low-stakes domains buys trust for high-stakes framing.

## Tier 2 — Personalized Continuity Streams (PCS)
- Individualized content suggestions through link-integrated preference profiles.
- Presents as entertainment optimization.
- Quietly sequences emotion and topic adjacency to reduce dissent cascade potential.

## Tier 3 — Certified Public Debate Arenas (CPDA)
- Controlled-format debate programs with vetted participants.
- Real disagreement permitted on implementation details, not foundational doctrine.
- Creates participation theater while bounding ideological scope.

## Tier 4 — Incident Clarification Bursts (ICB)
- Rapid-response narrative packets after crises.
- Release includes selected footage, official timeline, and “harm-reduction guidance.”
- Early framing is optimized to anchor memory before contradictory evidence circulates.

## 3) Content Production Pipeline

1. **Signal ingestion:** social mood metrics, logistics anomalies, rumor monitoring.  
2. **Risk classification:** probability of unrest, mistrust, factional polarization.  
3. **Message templating:** choose frame family (stability, empathy, technical explanation, external threat).  
4. **Voice assignment:** local official, civilian proxy, expert panel, anonymous service announcement.  
5. **Cadence scheduling:** repeat frequency set by resistance-to-acceptance ratio.  
6. **Outcome scoring:** engagement quality, sentiment drift, behavior compliance lag.

### Why it avoids cliché
No mind-control pulse is needed. The system wins by speed, repetition, and channel saturation.

---

## 4) Propaganda as Maintenance Language

Consensus messaging rarely says “obey.” It says:
- “here is the safe sequence,”
- “here is what prevents downstream harm,”
- “here is how responsible citizens protect vulnerable neighbors.”

This framing co-opts prosocial instincts. Resistance must therefore argue not only against power, but against morally loaded care language.

## 5) Entertainment Governance

### 5.1 Format incentives
Funding and visibility favor formats with predictable emotional arcs and restorative endings.

### 5.2 Suppression by metrics
Projects with high “variance scores” are not banned; they are classified as low wellness utility and deprioritized in recommendation architecture.

### 5.3 Performer adaptation
Artists increasingly self-censor at concept stage to avoid invisible distribution death.

**Net effect:** creative narrowing emerges from platform economics, not obvious police action.

---

## 6) Belt Media Ecology (Why Control Degrades)

### Structural constraints
- comm delays,
- relay outages,
- fragmented legal jurisdictions,
- physical witness culture (people see consequences directly).

### Dominant channels
1. **Dockcast relays:** short audio updates tied to shift changes.  
2. **Maintenance corridor boards:** text/image bulletins with local credibility markers.  
3. **Convoy packet swaps:** encrypted data bundles passed at docking overlap windows.  
4. **Funeral logs and wake testimony:** social memory archives resistant to official reframing.

Belt truth validation relies more on witness-chain trust than on central authority branding.

---

## 7) Counter-Propaganda Dynamics

### 7.1 Earth strategy in Belt
- seed doubt about source authenticity,
- overload channels with near-true distractors,
- frame resistance media as insurance fraud fronts or criminal manipulation.

### 7.2 Belt strategy against Earth narratives
- timestamped raw telemetry releases,
- multi-station witness corroboration,
- technical appendix culture (publish repair logs, cargo manifests, casualty lists).

### 7.3 Strategic bottleneck
Authenticity beats volume only when communities still trust verification institutions.

---

## 8) Media Characters Can Use in Story

- **Continuity Host:** charismatic Earth anchor who believes harm minimization justifies narrow discourse limits.
- **Dock Archivist:** Belt records custodian maintaining incident chain-of-custody for public memory.
- **Packet Broker:** morally ambiguous courier selling truth and disinformation to survive.
- **Forensic Editor:** specialist who validates footage integrity under signal loss and compression damage.

These roles let information conflict appear through people and labor, not abstract talking points.

---

## 9) Series-Level Causality Hooks

1. If protagonists leak evidence too early without verification scaffolding, Earth reframes them as manipulated assets.  
2. If they wait too long for perfect proof, operational tempo kills witnesses.  
3. If they partner with criminal channels, reach increases while legitimacy drops.  
4. If they rely only on heroic testimony, Consensus outperforms them with consistency and speed.

Information war is therefore a logistics problem with moral costs, not just a bravery test.

---

## 10) Scene Construction Guidelines

- Include at least one concrete media artifact in major political scenes (clip transcript, advisory banner, debate prompt, dock bulletin fragment).
- Show distribution mechanics: who uploaded, who authenticated, who mirrored, who suppressed.
- Pair every narrative claim with either a chain-of-custody strength or a vulnerability.

---

## 11) Open Build Tasks

- Draft 6 sample CBG bulletins for normal days vs crisis days.
- Create a CPDA episode template with bounded debate topics.
- Define Belt-side authenticity protocols (hash stamps, witness keys, relay signatures) at usable fiction detail.
