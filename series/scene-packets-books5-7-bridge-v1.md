## BOOK 5 — *Charter Under Scarcity*

### Packet B5-S01 — Charter Oxygen Vote
**Objective:** Keep Belt charter bloc intact during first life-support allocation vote under visible scarcity.  
**Conflict:** Habitat delegates threaten walkout after FVB raids delay oxygen canister convoys; Lin must choose speed (executive decree) or legitimacy (slow counted vote).  
**Tactical geometry:** Ceres-Pallas canister lanes at 0.22–0.61 AU; convoy escort limited to BC-B profile due radiator fatigue. Earth legal consultation unusable in-window at 2–20+ minute one-way lag by node.  
**Emotional turn:** Lin begins ready to impose order, then yields floor time to small habitats and nearly loses the bloc—earning procedural legitimacy at personal cost.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: vote passes 51-49. Delayed: convoy shortfalls trigger ration protests. Arc dependency: Book 5 handoff condition (charter survives first stress cycle) remains barely satisfied; Branch B risk flagged.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0310; Book 5 row, `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`; mission chain `B5-S01`.

### Packet B5-S02 — Spiral Pier Ambush
**Objective:** Break a Freed Voider Bands recruitment funnel at a docking pier without mass civilian detention optics.  
**Conflict:** Marko can seal and sweep (effective, abusive) or run targeted snatch operations (slower, leak-prone).  
**Tactical geometry:** Rotating pier interior, mixed-g. Boarding teams mag-clamp before firing; recoil drift turns one corridor into no-fire zone. 27-minute tactical window before convoy undock.  
**Emotional turn:** Marko, expecting a clean tactical success, is forced to release coerced teenage runners to preserve legitimacy evidence chain.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: funnel nodes identified, two recruiters captured alive. Delayed: released runners become witness-liability and protection burden. Arc dependency: anti-FVB doctrine shifts from suppression-only to recruitment-disruption requirement for Book 7 corridor law.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0315; FVB dossier; mission chain `B5-S02`.

### Packet B5-S03 — Class-2 Queue Riot on Vesta Ring
**Objective:** Prevent fab-allocation board collapse after manipulated queue data sparks riot.  
**Conflict:** Isaac can restore services by privileged override (fast, anti-plural) or accept a six-hour blackout during audited rebuild.  
**Tactical geometry:** Data center in spin gravity, perimeter firefight in low-g maintenance spine requiring tethered movement and controlled single-shot discipline. Sensor confidence 0.62 due spoof packets.  
**Emotional turn:** Isaac chooses the blackout he feared; civilians curse him while audit logs later prove sabotage.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: board survives, three fabrication lines remain offline. Delayed: insulin and sealant shortages spread to two habitats. Arc dependency: Book 6 parity race starts under trust deficit but with anti-capture controls intact.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0320; Branch C prevention; mission chain `B5-S03`.

### Packet B5-S04 — Bitter Amnesty Berth
**Objective:** Process ex-Steward technicians requesting reintegration without enabling soft recapture.  
**Conflict:** Hale wants strict exclusion; Lin argues selective reintegration is required for throughput survival.  
**Tactical geometry:** Berth transfer under 0.4 AU threat shadow; verification data arrives with 3–11 minute stagger, preventing instant innocence/culpability calls.  
**Emotional turn:** Hale publicly endorses conditional acceptance for one engineer tied to prior atrocities, splitting his own supporters.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: maintenance backlog drops 7% after onboarding. Delayed: victim blocs accuse charter government of amnesty laundering. Arc dependency: keeps Book 5 Class-2 board functioning, but raises Book 6 oversight capture risk.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0325; Book 5 handoff #3; mission chain `B5-S04`.

### Packet B5-S05 — Insurance War at Needle Gate
**Objective:** Reopen convoy insurance market after serial piracy drives rates to system-breaking levels.  
**Conflict:** Valerie can promise aggressive escort ROE (deterrent, collateral risk) or constrained interception with appeals board (slower confidence recovery).  
**Tactical geometry:** Gate crossing at 0.73 AU median spread; escorts running BC-C pulses accumulate heat debt requiring 18-hour cooldown rotations.  
**Emotional turn:** Valerie, known for hard deterrence, accepts restrained ROE and takes blame for one avoidable cargo loss.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: three insurers re-enter limited coverage. Delayed: black-market “guarantee” syndicates undercut lawful contracts. Arc dependency: corridor governance prototype for Book 7 inspection-sanctions-appeals architecture.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0330; Book 7 prerequisite; mission chain `B5-S05`.

### Packet B5-S06 — Quiet Court, Loud Airlocks
**Objective:** Keep a tribunal hearing alive during coordinated intimidation of witnesses and judges.  
**Conflict:** Security proposes sealed proceeding; civics groups demand public access.  
**Tactical geometry:** Court station life-support ducts become attack vectors; defense teams move in low-g service shafts, weapons only from brace points to avoid ricochet decompression.  
**Emotional turn:** Lin opens partial live feed despite risk, then must watch a witness recant on-air under fear.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: hearing remains legally valid but morally bruised. Delayed: witness protection housing demand triples. Arc dependency: legitimacy survives, reinforcing Book 6 need for non-military institutional investment.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0335; governance continuity chain; mission chain `B5-S06`.

### Packet B5-S07 — First Stress Winter
**Objective:** Hold charter coalition through synchronized oxygen, coolant, and food shortfalls during deep-space winter cycle.  
**Conflict:** Emergency centralization could save lives fast but violates anti-monopoly commitments.  
**Tactical geometry:** Multi-lane shortages across 0.2–1.1 AU network; no rapid redistribution possible under BC-B cadence and depleted escort fuel.  
**Emotional turn:** Collective leadership that spent months sharing authority grants Hale temporary reserve-command role with sunset timer—then enforces the sunset on schedule.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: mortality spike limited below collapse threshold. Delayed: reserve stocks are exhausted entering Book 6. Arc dependency: Book 5 closes with charter survival and codified anti-FVB doctrine intact, but industrial race pressure sharply elevated.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0340; Book 5 handoff conditions complete; mission chain `B5-S07`.

## BOOK 6 — *Parity Without Capture*

### Packet B6-S01 — Coolant Parliament
**Objective:** Allocate coolant among warship yards, hospital fabs, and habitat recyclers without board capture.  
**Conflict:** Isaac and Lin split on efficiency versus plural oversight at a moment where delay kills.  
**Tactical geometry:** Supply convoys from 0.8 AU outpost arrive in 19-day stagger; no same-day re-task. Board votes occur under stale telemetry bands.  
**Emotional turn:** Isaac surrenders weighted emergency vote and accepts a narrower plan that saves fewer hulls but more civilians.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: hospital uptime preserved; escort readiness drops. Delayed: piracy risk rises in two corridors. Arc dependency: demonstrates anti-capture constraint under pressure (Book 6 condition #1 in progress).
**Continuity refs:** seq 0350; Book 6 row; mission chain `B6-S01`.

### Packet B6-S02 — Standards War in Drydock Nine
**Objective:** Prevent sabotage-by-standard where rival firmware protocols can brick mixed fab fleets.  
**Conflict:** Ex-Steward experts offer a fast proprietary patch with hidden control hooks.  
**Tactical geometry:** Drydock engagement across articulated truss in low-g vacuum; cutters and carbines used only with dual-point tethering; debris cloud reduces sensor confidence to 0.48.  
**Emotional turn:** Hale rejects his own tactical adviser’s “temporary closed stack” plan, forcing open-standards patching that takes longer and costs a dock.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: one dock lost, fleet-wide lockout averted. Delayed: throughput dips 11% for six weeks. Arc dependency: Branch C (new monopoly) pressure reduced; Book 6 anti-capture controls strengthened.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0355; Branch C mitigation; mission chain `B6-S02`.

### Packet B6-S03 — Ghost Ledger Procurement Sting
**Objective:** Expose procurement sabotage ring siphoning Class-2 outputs into black channels.  
**Conflict:** Valerie can burn covert sources now or let theft continue to map full network.  
**Tactical geometry:** Sting synchronized over three nodes at 0.15, 0.47, and 0.9 AU separation; arrest teams cannot adapt in real time due lag, must execute pre-committed branches.  
**Emotional turn:** Valerie waits one cycle longer than her instincts allow, then loses a shipment she could have saved—capturing the ringleader instead.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: ring leadership seized with admissible accounting chain. Delayed: temporary shortages trigger accusations of staged scarcity. Arc dependency: supports Book 6 condition #1 (oversight survives sabotage wave).
**Continuity refs:** seq 0360; mission chain `B6-S03`.

### Packet B6-S04 — Labor Mutiny at Forge Crescent
**Objective:** Defuse labor walkout at major fab crescent without military seizure of production.  
**Conflict:** Commanders want compulsory shifts under emergency statute; labor delegates demand rotation safety after fatigue deaths.  
**Tactical geometry:** Crescent spins at partial-g; safety incidents concentrated in transfer spokes where micro-g tool recoil caused fatal drift impacts.  
**Emotional turn:** Marko, former enforcer, sides with labor safety stoppage and orders escorts to stand down from intimidation posture.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: strike settles with enforced sleep-cycle caps and hazard pauses. Delayed: output backlog worsens before stabilizing. Arc dependency: parity gains slow but civilian legitimacy metrics improve (Book 6 condition #3 path).
**Continuity refs:** seq 0365; reality gate fatigue lock; mission chain `B6-S04`.

### Packet B6-S05 — Sunset Audit Trap
**Objective:** Prove emergency powers actually expire while adversaries provoke crisis to justify extension.  
**Conflict:** Fresh FVB convoy bombings create genuine panic; extending powers looks prudent and politically easy.  
**Tactical geometry:** Audit servers distributed across latency-separated nodes; results cannot be forged centrally fast enough if witnesses compare timestamp chains.  
**Emotional turn:** Hale signs the expiration order during active threat alerts, accepting probable tactical loss to preserve constitutional credibility.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: emergency board powers sunset on schedule. Delayed: response tempo drops for two weeks, with measurable convoy losses. Arc dependency: Book 6 condition #2 (sunset compliance demonstrated) is satisfied.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0370; governance lock; mission chain `B6-S05`.

### Packet B6-S06 — Spare Parts Triage on the Long Arc
**Objective:** Choose which corridors receive scarce reactor bearing kits before cascade failures.  
**Conflict:** Data suggests military lanes first; civilian mortality modeling demands opposite priority.  
**Tactical geometry:** Bearing kits require 31–74 day transit windows depending corridor; no emergency sprint without heat penalties that would cancel gains.  
**Emotional turn:** Isaac and Lin reconcile after prolonged split by publishing a joint triage model they both dislike but can defend publicly.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: two military escorts sidelined, three habitat grids stabilized. Delayed: hawk factions accuse leadership of strategic naïveté. Arc dependency: keeps civilian stability metrics from collapse while preserving plural oversight.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0375; Book 6 condition #3; mission chain `B6-S06`.

### Packet B6-S07 — Parity Proof Night
**Objective:** Demonstrate industrial parity milestone without triggering fear of replacement tyranny.  
**Conflict:** Celebration optics invite triumphal centralization rhetoric; survivors demand humility and safeguards first.  
**Tactical geometry:** Facility tours and remote attestations staggered by lag; no single master broadcast can synchronize narrative across system.  
**Emotional turn:** Leadership cancels victory declaration and instead signs rotating key-control protocol with external auditors.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: parity recognized as governance achievement, not faction capture. Delayed: hardliners reframe restraint as weakness. Arc dependency: Book 6 closes with anti-capture regime intact and civilian metric gains fragile but real, enabling Book 7 chokepoint push.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0380; Book 6 handoff achieved; mission chain `B6-S07`.

## BOOK 7 — *Corridor Law*

### Packet B7-S01 — Three-Lane Funeral Convoy
**Objective:** Protect civilian funeral convoy through contested Mars-Earth-Ceres approach where FVB cells stage symbolic mass-casualty attack.  
**Conflict:** Valerie can pre-clear entire lane with broad exclusion fire or maintain constrained ROE and risk breakthrough.  
**Tactical geometry:** Escort wedge spans staggered vectors at 0.3–0.9 AU operational separation; command intent fragments under lag, forcing captain-level autonomy.  
**Emotional turn:** Valerie abandons punitive sweep after ambiguous sensor contacts resolve as neutral salvage craft.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: convoy survives; one attacker escapes. Delayed: critics brand operation soft. Arc dependency: supports Book 7 condition #2 (casualty trends decline without legitimacy collapse).
**Continuity refs:** seq 0390; Book 7 row; mission chain `B7-S01`.

### Packet B7-S02 — Inspection Line at Meridian Spine
**Objective:** Implement corridor inspection regime that can detect disguised strike cargos without strangling trade.  
**Conflict:** Traders demand speed; security demands exhaustive scans that exceed queue tolerance.  
**Tactical geometry:** Meridian Spine throughput caps at fixed berth turnover; each deep scan adds 14 minutes and cascades into day-scale delays.  
**Emotional turn:** Hale accepts a failed first day with visible queue collapse rather than fake “perfect throughput” metrics.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: two weapons cargos intercepted, perishables spoil in backlog. Delayed: appeals board workload explodes. Arc dependency: Book 7 condition #1 (inspection + sanctions + appeals) begins functioning imperfectly.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0395; corridor governance stack; mission chain `B7-S02`.

### Packet B7-S03 — False Positive at Cinder Junction
**Objective:** Prevent retaliatory strike after mislabeled sensor return identifies a hospital tug as pirate mothership.  
**Conflict:** Marko must countermand a respected escort captain minutes before launch authorization chain closes.  
**Tactical geometry:** Sensor fusion degraded by flare and spoof buoys; confidence split 0.41/0.59 across model sets. Comms lag blocks full adjudication before weapon window.  
**Emotional turn:** Marko, known for decisive violence, publicly aborts strike and absorbs accusations of cowardice.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: civilian catastrophe avoided. Delayed: pirates exploit restraint window elsewhere. Arc dependency: reinforces no-mass-casualty-legitimacy-collapse condition.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0400; reality gate sensor lock; mission chain `B7-S03`.

### Packet B7-S04 — Sanctions Hearing Under Fire
**Objective:** Complete first enforceable sanctions ruling against corridor violators during active intimidation campaign.  
**Conflict:** Emergency military decree could bypass process and look stronger; legal route is slower and vulnerable.  
**Tactical geometry:** Hearing node under intermittent micro-meteor shielding outages; security teams rotate on sleep-degraded cycles after 72-hour alert period.  
**Emotional turn:** Lin refuses secret evidence submission and risks losing the case—then wins narrowly with public chain-of-custody proofs.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: sanctions regime gains legal teeth. Delayed: targeted harassment of adjudicators increases. Arc dependency: corridor law legitimacy rises, but institutional fatigue debt accumulates toward Book 8 approach staging.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0405; Book 7 condition #1 maturity; mission chain `B7-S04`.

### Packet B7-S05 — The Narrow Mercy Raid
**Objective:** Interdict FVB terror cell staging decompression attack while preserving live captures for recruitment-funnel intelligence.  
**Conflict:** Valerie wants certainty kill-box; Isaac insists live capture is required to collapse pipeline economics.  
**Tactical geometry:** Boarding in zero-g tank farm; all operators hard-anchor before short controlled bursts, then transition to restraints to avoid ricochet punctures.  
**Emotional turn:** Valerie lowers weapon on a principal target to enable capture, trading immediate catharsis for system-level disruption.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: attack prevented; recruitment financiers identified. Delayed: captured footage used by rivals to paint leadership as weak on terror. Arc dependency: anti-FVB strategy matures beyond suppression, preserving Book 10 reintegration pathway options.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0410; FVB policy lock from strategy log; mission chain `B7-S05`.

### Packet B7-S06 — Corridor Law Threshold
**Objective:** Decide whether chokepoint campaign has sufficient legitimacy and casualty trend to hand off into Book 8 Earth-approach staging.  
**Conflict:** Hawks demand expansion now; civil planners warn support systems are one shock away from fracture.  
**Tactical geometry:** Campaign review aggregates six months of lane data across delayed reporting windows; some losses remain unresolved due comm latency and missing logs.  
**Emotional turn:** Hale declines symbolic “victory advance,” backing a slower handoff once appeal backlog and escort fatigue indicators pass minimum thresholds.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: operations tempo reduced 12%, legitimacy indicators improve. Delayed: adversaries gain breathing room to reconfigure. Arc dependency: Book 7 exits with functioning corridor governance, declining casualties, and no singular legitimacy-collapse massacre.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0415; handoff to Book 8 preconditions; mission chain `B7-S06`.

## Coverage Check (20 / 20)
- Book 5 packets: 7
- Book 6 packets: 7
- Book 7 packets: 6

All packets include tactical geometry, emotional reversal, and explicit consequence ledgers tied to Books 5–7 dependencies in the 10-book arc grid.

## Contradiction-Check Summary (Packet Set)
- Reality Gate constraints satisfied in every packet (anchoring, burn/heat limits, comm latency, logistics, fatigue, sensor uncertainty).
- No instantaneous reinforcement, omniscient command, or unlimited munitions claims introduced.
- Character-state progression remains cumulative (no reset of Book 5-7 institutional growth arcs).
- FVB treatment remains dual-track: hard interdiction + recruitment-funnel disruption + reintegration intelligence.
- Governance outcomes retain debt/cost; no clean-win or zero-legitimacy-cost resolutions.

## Wave 14 Consequence-Chain Deepening Addendum (Books 5–7)

Expanded each packet cluster with delayed-systemic effects, legitimacy externalities, logistics debt rollover, and interpersonal carryover into the Earth-approach gate.

| Packet band | Delayed-systemic effect | Legitimacy fallout | Logistics debt carryover | Relationship stress carryover |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B5-S01..S02 | Oxygen-vote precedent and funnel-disruption doctrine create durable due-process burdens for security ops. | Narrow vote + selective releases fuels "soft on terror / hard on poor" dual narrative. | Escort and witness-protection drawdowns reduce buffer inventories before stress winter. | Lin/Marko friction increases over detention thresholds and optics risk. |
| B5-S03..S04 | Audit-first queue governance prevents capture but normalizes service interruption cycles. | Conditional reintegration interpreted as amnesty laundering by victim blocs. | Fab downtime + vetting overhead pushes maintenance backlog into B5-S07 crunch. | Hale's compromise posture strains standing with hardline survivors and with himself. |
| B5-S05..S07 | Insurance + tribunal + winter governance forms proto-corridor-law institutions under scarcity trauma. | Public reads lawful delay as elite insulation when shortages persist. | Cooldown, reserve exhaustion, and housing burden set weak initial state for B6 coolant politics. | Valerie's restraint and Lin's transparency choices absorb blame, increasing burnout risk. |
| B6-S01..S03 | Anti-capture infrastructure becomes sticky norm across coolant, standards, and procurement chains. | Throughput losses become propaganda material for restorationists. | Dock loss + sting delay + escort cuts create piracy exposure window mid-Book 6. | Isaac-Valerie tension rises around "acceptable losses" in intelligence pacing decisions. |
| B6-S04..S05 | Labor safety and sunset compliance harden constitutional culture under active threat. | Letting powers expire during attacks is framed as negligence by hawk blocs. | Shift caps and slower command tempo produce measurable convoy attrition debt. | Hale accepts tactical blame; trust with labor rises while command cadre trust thins. |
| B6-S06..S07 | Joint triage model and parity-with-restraint doctrine become prerequisites for Book 7 legitimacy. | Restraint is publicly misread as weakness even as civilian metrics improve. | Spare-part prioritization sidelines combat lanes entering chokepoint campaign. | Isaac/Lin reconcile operationally but under persistent moral fatigue and reputational scar tissue. |
| B7-S01..S03 | ROE-constrained convoy defense institutionalizes false-positive abort norms. | Surviving with escaped attackers feeds "performative legality" criticism. | Escort wear and redirected patrols generate latent vulnerability in secondary lanes. | Valerie/Marko absorb cowardice accusations for restraint decisions, tightening internal solidarity but isolating them publicly. |
| B7-S04..S06 | Sanctions/appeals stack matures into auditable corridor-law backbone for Book 8 handoff. | Adjudicator targeting and queue delays erode confidence despite lawful wins. | Institutional fatigue debt (sleep, hull hours, med slots) forces tempo reduction before Earth approach. | Hale's deliberate slowdown strategy strains hawk allies but prevents team fracture. |

### Contradiction-Check Summary (Wave 14 Addendum)
- No B5–B7 success beat remains cost-free; each now projects at least one structural debt into subsequent packets.
- Added legitimacy fallout is bidirectional (security hawks and civil critics), avoiding one-sided propaganda realism gaps.
- Logistics debt chains are explicitly transit/maintenance bounded; no miraculous replenishment inserted.
- Relationship stress carryover is cumulative and compatible with existing reconciliation beats.
