## Why This Matrix Exists

The 10-book reconquest arc will drift unless each book has explicit institutional payloads, not only plot beats. This matrix maps strategic phase goals to institution evolution, character burdens, and continuity hazards.

---

## Global Integration Rules

1. Each book must introduce or materially evolve at least two institutions.
2. No institution may become universally trusted without an on-page failure and reform cycle.
3. Military gains must unlock governance problems in the following book.
4. Legal process should lag behind battlefield events, creating realistic friction.
5. Blackfly pursuit must use unknown-position dragnet logic (missing asset awareness, not continuous location certainty).
6. Transit and fabrication constraints must appear in planning assumptions, not just background lore.

## Book-by-Book Institutional Payloads

## Book 1 — Betrayal Ignition

### Institutional Focus
- EDF-MPA contract coercion exposure.
- OCC scarcity narrative manipulation glimpsed through mission logistics anomalies.

### Character Burden Link
Hale and Valerie begin as newly unbound free operators after the Blackfly break, carrying survival logic plus obligations to witness and remember procedural abuse.

### Continuity Hazard
Over-framing Book 1 as pure action can erase legal coercion scaffolding needed later.

### Integration Objective
Establish that betrayal is systemic design, not rogue commander accident.

---

## Book 2 — Alliance Market

### Institutional Focus
- BMAX trust economy and obligation debt.
- SACT legal machinery labeling fugitives as existential threats.

### Character Burden Link
Valerie’s restraint and Hale’s credibility both depend on handling alliances without becoming mercenary.

### Continuity Hazard
Alliances portrayed as informal friendships only (missing economic/legal binding reality).

### Integration Objective
Show that legitimacy has to be bought with risk, reciprocity, and documentation.

---

## Book 3 — Proof Warfare

### Institutional Focus
- CSTN-like archive practices emerge against narrative monopoly.
- CSVD safety doctrine contested through evidence chain conflicts.

### Character Burden Link
Isaac moves from hacker to institutional architect; Lin carries moral cost of disclosure timing.

### Continuity Hazard
Treating info release as instant public conversion.

### Integration Objective
Demonstrate that truth requires process, and process is contested terrain.

---

## Book 4 — Transition Rupture

### Institutional Focus
- AL-PCA provisional coordination stress-tested.
- SACT/legacy legal institutions face credibility fractures.

### Character Burden Link
Core team splits on means versus ends while forced into proto-state responsibilities.

### Continuity Hazard
Skipping the ugly coalition bargaining that makes later governance believable.

### Integration Objective
Move protagonists from tactical actors to reluctant institution shapers.

---

## Book 5 — Belt Consolidation

### Institutional Focus
- AL-PCA interoperability compacts.
- SFAB counter-models via distributed allocation pilots.

### Character Burden Link
Marko and Isaac clash over resilient architecture versus speed.

### Continuity Hazard
Turning Belt consolidation into a montage with no governance tradeoffs.

### Integration Objective
Establish durable anti-monopoly institutions without pretending consensus is easy.

---

## Book 6 — Industrial Parity Race

### Institutional Focus
- SFAB queue wars and technician sanctuary law.
- ITAS procedural maneuvering around strategic lanes.

### Character Burden Link
Team must defend fairness norms while tempted to exploit captured scheduler tools.

### Continuity Hazard
Fabrication race depicted as purely technical output contest.

### Integration Objective
Show production power as legal, social, and coercive architecture.

---

## Book 7 — Chokepoint Campaigns

### Institutional Focus
- ITAS legitimacy crisis under wartime arbitration pressure.
- OCC emergency continuity decrees weaponized at scale.

### Character Burden Link
Hale/Lin conflict over convoy ethics and strategic tempo becomes central.

### Continuity Hazard
Naval action overwhelms civilian-flow governance stakes.

### Integration Objective
Tie operational victories to transparent lane governance commitments.

---

## Book 8 — Earth Approach Operations

### Institutional Focus
- CSVD fragmentation and safety-pluralism fight.
- RSLB pre-reconstruction standards become contested before landfall.

### Character Burden Link
Valerie/Isaac seed-governance conflicts become public constitutional issue.

### Continuity Hazard
Treating Earth approach as only military staging.

### Integration Objective
Make clear that whoever writes standards now controls justice later.

---

## Book 9 — Earth Reconquest

### Institutional Focus
- Transitional justice proto-tribunals (Track 1/2/3 model).
- Emergency service continuity under combined RSLB + Stability Cell doctrines.

### Character Burden Link
Marko presses reintegration reality against victory euphoria.

### Continuity Hazard
“Big battle ends everything” closure.

### Integration Objective
Make reconquest feel like governance entry, not finale.

---

## Book 10 — Settlement Struggle

### Institutional Focus
- Constitutional redesign of SACT/CSVD successor structures.
- Permanent CSTN-grade anti-amnesia and audit protections.

### Character Burden Link
All core characters must choose between concentrated efficiency and distributed legitimacy.

### Continuity Hazard
Neat constitutional ending without implementation pain.

### Integration Objective
Deliver anti-relapse architecture that is enforceable under resource scarcity and political fatigue.

## Institutional Maturity Ladder

Use this ladder to track each institution’s arc:
1. **Opaque utility** (works but hidden coercion).
2. **Exposure shock** (abuse becomes visible).
3. **Contested reform** (faction fight over purpose).
4. **Partial redesign** (new rules, old habits linger).
5. **Auditable legitimacy** (not perfect, but challengeable and bounded).

No major institution should jump from stage 1 to 5 in one book.

---

## Hand-off Requirements Between Books

At each book boundary, include:
- One unresolved institutional debt.
- One procedural innovation with unclear consequences.
- One character relationship altered by institutional choice.
- One logistics constraint that narrows next-book options.

This preserves continuity pressure and prevents reset syndrome.

---

## Contradiction Watchlist (Series-Level)

1. If any book implies unlimited mobility, reinsert transit envelope constraints.
2. If any faction gets risk-free Class 1/2 access, reintroduce queue/security and technician bottlenecks.
3. If justice appears costless, add staffing, legitimacy, or retaliation consequences.
4. If coalition appears unified, show internal doctrine disagreement with material stakes.
5. If Consensus appears omniscient, add data-latency or institutional conflict seams.
7. If pursuit scenes assume guaranteed enemy location certainty after Blackfly theft, patch to probabilistic dragnet behavior unless an explicit intel compromise is shown.
8. If warform scenes imply intact personal agency under full override, patch to remote-control taxonomy and ROE-consistent portrayal.
6. If small-body surface scenes imply normal walking/standing without stabilization, patch with anchoring and attitude-control mechanics.

---

## Writers’ Room Usage Pattern

- Start outline session by selecting 2 institutions + 1 doctrine conflict + 1 pressure test.
- Confirm TRACE-L effects for at least one flagship operation.
- Confirm continuity debts are handed into next book bible packet.
- Tag scenes with institution IDs to prevent accidental underuse.

---

## Outcome

This matrix turns the reconquest arc into a governed campaign rather than a sequence of disconnected climaxes. It preserves canon locks while expanding narrative capacity for politics, law, logistics, and character consequence.

## Continuity Note — Acquisition vs Training Data, Operator Status, Pursuit Awareness, Warform Taxonomy, and Small-Body Physics

- **AI acquisition event (LOCKED):** the AI seed/box is acquired in the **first-scene spec-ops extraction from the asteroid compound**.
- **Databank event (LOCKED):** the later databank raid is **not** AI acquisition; it is a **training/upgrade-data acquisition** event needed to expand/calibrate/harden the already-acquired AI.
- **Protagonist status (LOCKED):** crew exits EDF permanently when they steal Blackfly; they operate as free operators across coalition/civic/clandestine networks. EDF remains origin trauma/backstory only.
- **Escape-signature lock (LOCKED):** the compound nuclear strike covers immediate escape signature/tracks.
- **Enemy-awareness lock (LOCKED):** EDF/Consensus know Blackfly is missing but do **not** know current location. Pursuit uses probabilistic dragnet logic, not continuous direct tracking certainty.
- **Warform lock (LOCKED):** many hostile Spec Ops operators are fully overridden non-conscious human puppets driven by remote shipboard processor stacks (Class-1-line context). Treat as remote warforms in threat taxonomy and ROE; do not imply intact personal agency while full override is active.
- **Genre/frame rule (LOCKED):** narrative emphasis is **space opera first** with tactical realism, not ongoing EDF ownership framing.
- **Physics lock (LOCKED):** asteroid/small-body surface action requires explicit attachment/anchoring and attitude control; no normal walking depictions without active stabilization.
