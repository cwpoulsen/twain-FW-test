## Protocol Set A — Foundational Compact Principles

### A.1 Non-Mirror Rule
The coalition may centralize for survival but must not recreate monopoly governance under new branding. Every emergency concentration of power requires a sunset trigger and independent audit route.

### A.2 Plural Safety Rule
Safety validation and production allocation must remain institutionally separated. If one body both certifies and allocates, capture risk becomes regime-scale.

### A.3 Latency Responsibility Rule
Authority must be assigned to the level that can act with current information. Higher-level councils cannot retain veto powers they cannot exercise in time.

### A.4 Legibility Rule
Policies affecting life-support, transit, and legal status must be published in language ordinary civilians can parse. Technical opacity is treated as governance debt.

### A.5 Reciprocity Rule
Members receive solidarity commitments only if they honor minimum rights and transparency obligations.

## Protocol Set B — Decision Architecture

### B.1 Four-Chamber Decision Model
1. **Security Chamber:** military risk and force protection.
2. **Civil Chamber:** rights, displacement, and public welfare.
3. **Industrial Chamber:** fabrication, feedstock, and repair throughput.
4. **Legitimacy Chamber:** archive integrity, media, and diplomatic spillover.

Major actions require bicameral-style concurrence between Security + at least one non-security chamber. This prevents doctrinally clean but politically ruinous operations.

### B.2 Voting Modes
- **Routine mode:** weighted vote by contribution and affected-population share.
- **Crisis mode:** temporary accelerated vote with mandatory ex-post ratification.
- **Red-line mode:** any chamber can trigger pause if non-negotiable constraints are implicated.

### B.3 Deadlock Breakers
- Randomized rotating mediator panel from non-directly affected members.
- Time-boxed compromise drafting with default-to-status-quo if no consensus.
- Public explanation requirement for any override.

### B.4 Anti-Capture Design
- Term limits for chamber conveners.
- Mandatory dissent publication for major decisions.
- Conflict-of-interest declarations mirrored to public archive nodes.

**Authority citations:** `series/reconquest-institutional-integration-matrix-v1.md`; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (H, F); `timeline/books1-10-strategic-reconquest-map-v1.md`.

## Protocol Set C — Coalition Membership and Compliance

### C.1 Membership Tiers
- **Associate:** observer rights, limited operational commitments.
- **Participating:** full policy vote, constrained military interoperability.
- **Integrated:** full interoperability and shared liability obligations.

### C.2 Entry Criteria
- Adoption of minimum legal interoperability charter.
- Archive mirroring participation.
- Declared policy on governor-module legacy treatment.
- Docking and sanctuary standards for disputed warrants.

### C.3 Compliance Review Cycle
Quarterly review with scored dimensions:
1. Rights compliance.
2. Transparency compliance.
3. Operational reliability.
4. Anti-corruption integrity.
5. Civilian-harm mitigation performance.

### C.4 Corrective Ladder
- Advisory notice.
- Conditional participation limits.
- Targeted sanctions.
- Suspension with humanitarian carve-outs.

## Protocol Set D — Campaign Governance During Active Conflict

### D.1 Campaign Charter Requirement
No major campaign launch without a public charter that defines:
- Military objective.
- Civilian-protection obligations.
- Exit criteria.
- Review cadence.

### D.2 Branch Authorization Matrix
Each theater command receives bounded branch authorities pre-cleared by coalition chambers. The matrix includes legal constraints and humanitarian limits.

### D.3 Civilian Harm Trigger Points
Automatic strategic review triggers when one of these occurs:
- Civilian deprivation index exceeds threshold for two reporting periods.
- Neutral-carrier appeals backlog exceeds maximum latency-adjusted window.
- Independent archive nodes report unexplained discrepancy with official claims.

### D.4 Coalition Friction Handling
When members diverge, protocol prioritizes:
1. Stop irreversible escalations.
2. Protect life-support corridors.
3. Preserve evidence and publication continuity.
4. Resume offensive tempo only after chamber reconciliation.

**Authority citations:** `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (E, H, J); `tech/interplanetary-transit-and-comms-envelope-v1.md`; `factions/failure-modes-and-escalation.md`.

## Protocol Set E — AI Seed and Class 1 Governance

### E.1 Custody Principle
No single faction may hold unilateral activation path for the seed system or complete Class 1 chain authority.

### E.2 Multi-Key Control
Activation, model-update, and deployment each require separate key quorums from distinct institutions (technical, civil, legal, and military).

### E.3 Verification Pipeline
- Independent replication phase.
- Safety adversarial testing phase.
- Policy impact simulation phase.
- Controlled deployment phase with rollback conditions.

### E.4 Prohibited Practices
- Hidden forks.
- Undisclosed human subject testing.
- Secret unilateral acceleration using coalition resources.
- Suppression of adverse findings past defined emergency grace window.

### E.5 Breach Consequences
- Immediate pause and forensic audit.
- Temporary suspension of violator’s vote on related matters.
- Public incident notice with uncertainty labels.

## Protocol Set F — Economic Burden Sharing and Reparative Design

### F.1 Burden-Sharing Formula
Combine three factors:
1. Current capacity share.
2. Historical extraction benefit.
3. Conflict exposure and civilian harm burden.

### F.2 Reparations Channels
- Immediate stabilization grants.
- Long-term infrastructure credits.
- Service exemptions for heavily harmed jurisdictions.

### F.3 Guardrails
- Ban punitive debt structures disguised as aid.
- Require local labor participation to avoid occupation economy dynamics.
- Publish allocation rationale in plain language.

### F.4 Political Reality
Any formula will be contested. Protocol success is not universal agreement; it is sustained compliance without major defection.

## Protocol Set G — Transitional Justice Governance Interface

### G.1 Three-Track Integration
Coalition governance must coordinate with:
- Criminal prosecution track.
- Institutional accountability track.
- Civic restoration track.

### G.2 Eligibility and Triage Interface
Governance bodies may not pre-empt judicial fact-finding but may prioritize sequencing for social stability.

### G.3 Truth and Capacity Tradeoff
Publishing all evidence immediately can collapse fragile institutions; withholding too much destroys legitimacy. Protocol mandates phased disclosure schedules with independent oversight.

### G.4 Survivor Participation Requirement
Major amnesty or sentencing-framework decisions require structured survivor council input with published response to recommendations.

**Authority citations:** `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (F); `timeline/legal-linguistic-and-exile-mechanics-sequence-v1.md`; `characters/supporting-cast-and-antagonist-lattice-v1.md`.

---

## Protocol Set H — Coalition Collapse Prevention Ladder

### H.1 Early Warning Indicators
- Repeated emergency override without sunset follow-through.
- Divergence between chamber decisions and field execution.
- Archive trust degradation.
- Resource hoarding by major members.
- Escalating sanction retaliation cycles.

### H.2 Intervention Ladder
1. Quiet technical mediation.
2. Public procedural clarification.
3. Temporary authority rebalancing.
4. Confidence vote and leadership reshuffle.
5. Constitutional mini-convention on disputed domain.

### H.3 Red-Line Condition
If two major members begin unilateral strategic campaigns with incompatible legal claims, coalition enters “fracture mode” and must prioritize deconfliction over campaign tempo.

## Protocol Set I — Civic Interface and Social Legitimacy

### I.1 Public Deliberation Cadence
Regular open briefings with constrained classified annexes reduce rumor capture and disinformation vulnerability.

### I.2 Translation Requirement
All major directives must be published in major Belt and Earth language clusters, including legal simplifications and practical rights guides.

### I.3 Complaint Routing
Single-entry complaint portal is mirrored across jurisdictions with anti-retaliation protections and tracking IDs visible to complainants.

### I.4 Legitimacy Metric Basket
- Compliance rates.
- Appeal reversal rates.
- Civilian deprivation trends.
- Trust survey deltas.
- Defection and sabotage incidents.

### I.5 Human Texture Rule
Legitimacy is lived at queue counters, docks, clinics, and contract offices. Governance scenes should periodically ground abstract policy in these frontline interfaces.

## Protocol Set J — Editor’s Continuity Test

A governance chapter passes if:
1. At least one protocol constraint materially limits protagonists.
2. At least one opposition argument is institutionally coherent.
3. A decision creates a delayed secondary consequence.
4. Legal/economic/command domains interact visibly.
5. No actor behaves as if latency or records don’t exist.

If fewer than four criteria are met, revise before canon integration.

Pros: aligns decision power with contribution burdens.  
Cons: entrenches industrial hierarchies.

### L.3 Harm-Adjusted Hybrid
Combines population, capacity, and historical harm exposure.

### L.4 Rotating Minority Veto Domains
Allow targeted veto rights in domains where minority survival risk is highest (e.g., life-support access, forced rendition).

### O.1 Canonical Public Record Procedure
Each major decision produces:
- Summary for general audiences.
- Technical annex for specialists.
- Legal annex with authority basis.
- Dissent annex preserving minority reasoning.

### O.2 Correction Etiquette
Corrections are mandatory, time-stamped, and non-destructive (original remains visible).

### O.3 Narrative Harm Control
Ban celebratory framing of operations with unresolved civilian-harm claims.

Actions under verified coercion with full truth obligations and reparative participation.

### P.3 Restorative Justice Channel
For mid-tier bureaucratic complicity where prosecution would collapse administrative continuity.

### P.4 Public Legitimacy Clause
Any amnesty package must include survivor representation, clear rationale, and review triggers.

## Protocol Set Q — Coalition Failure-Recovery Playbook

### Q.1 Failure Type: Governance Paralysis
Symptom: unresolved deadlocks, rising unilateral action.  
Response: temporary emergency steering team with strict expiry and chamber oversight.

### Q.2 Failure Type: Legitimacy Crash
Symptom: archive distrust, protest escalation, compliance decline.  
Response: accelerated disclosure, independent inquiry, and visible leadership concessions.

### Q.3 Failure Type: Capacity Collapse
Symptom: critical service interruption, procurement deadlock, mass displacement.  
Response: mutual aid surge, simplified emergency procurement, external technical assistance.

### Q.4 Failure Type: Security Fragmentation
Symptom: regional commands diverge from coalition authority.  
Response: command conference, bounded autonomy reset, sanctions as last resort.

## Protocol Set R — Human-Scale Governance Interface Scenes

### R.1 Queue Counter Scene
A civilian argues with clerk over emergency med priority while both rely on opaque rulebook nobody can fully explain.

### R.2 Dock Hearing Scene
Carrier captain challenges detention under delayed appeal packet; dock board cites dual-jurisdiction constraints.

### R.3 Survivor Council Scene
Coalition leaders present amnesty draft and must answer plain-language questions from harmed families.

### R.4 Veteran Placement Scene
Reintegration officer negotiates labor placement amid neighborhood resistance and media scrutiny.

Use these scenes to test whether protocol abstractions produce believable social outcomes.
