## BOOK 8 — *Approach Without Illusion*

### Packet B8-S01 — Kessler Bargain at Perigee Ledger
**Objective:** Ratify shared Earth-approach ROE across coalition, labor escorts, and defected command cadres.  
**Conflict:** Hawks demand preemptive strike authority before civilian corridors are certified.  
**Tactical geometry:** Staging shells at staggered high orbit with BC-C burn ceilings; any unscheduled sprint burns radiator margin needed for medevac windows.  
**Emotional reversal:** Hale enters expecting command-first consensus, then publicly accepts civilian veto triggers that can halt his own operation plans.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: ROE compact signed with pause clauses. Delayed: strike opportunities are missed by design. Arc dependency: satisfies Book 8 condition #3 foundation and blocks Branch D fast-collapse path.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0420; Book 8 row, `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`; mission chain `B8-S01`.

### Packet B8-S02 — Dockworker Referendum Under Siren Silence
**Objective:** Verify Earth-side labor councils as civil partners for port turnover.  
**Conflict:** Lin can accept fast but coercive proxy ratifications or endure slow open balloting under bombardment threat.  
**Tactical geometry:** Orbital relay outages create 6–24 minute signaling gaps; dock security teams operate with pre-briefed rules and no live override.  
**Emotional reversal:** Lin chooses the slower vote and watches one allied council defect after intimidation, yet keeps the process legitimate.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: three major ports certify partners, one fails. Delayed: re-routing increases queue delay by 19 hours. Arc dependency: Book 8 condition #1 partially satisfied with verifiable but incomplete partner map.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0425; mission chain `B8-S02`; timeline cross-link `books8-10` map.

### Packet B8-S03 — Powder Corridor Feint
**Objective:** Hold approach corridor against FVB decoy strikes meant to trigger overreaction optics.  
**Conflict:** Valerie can authorize saturation fire at uncertain contacts or absorb attrition while isolating confirmed hostile vectors.  
**Tactical geometry:** Multi-axis clutter field with spoof buoys; confidence never exceeds 0.64; escort wings fuel-limited to one hard intercept cycle.  
**Emotional reversal:** Valerie aborts a near-certain kill because target ID cannot exclude refugee tug signatures.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: corridor remains open, one pirate cell escapes. Delayed: critics brand ROE suicidal. Arc dependency: protects casualty-decline credibility required for Books 8->9 handoff.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0430; mission chain `B8-S03`; Branch D prevention note.

### Packet B8-S04 — Prisoner Exchange at Lagrange Slipyard
**Objective:** Execute POW exchange without allowing hardliner cadres to seed sabotage teams into approach fleet.  
**Conflict:** Marko can cancel exchange after one biometrics mismatch or proceed under layered quarantine and risk political backlash.  
**Tactical geometry:** Slipyard transfer lanes require staggered dock cycles; each additional scan adds 11 minutes and compounds exposure window.  
**Emotional reversal:** Marko, historically distrustful, proceeds with exchange and later defends release of a former enemy medic who saves coalition casualties.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: 312 POWs exchanged, 2 suspects held pending hearing. Delayed: propaganda war erupts over “mercy to traitors.” Arc dependency: keeps postwar governability channel alive for Book 10 reintegration debates.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0435; mission chain `B8-S04`; FVB/integration lock.

### Packet B8-S05 — Glacier Stack Preposition Failure
**Objective:** Salvage campaign-cycle stockpile plan after a coolant depot cascade failure.  
**Conflict:** Isaac can cannibalize hospital reserves to preserve war tempo or accept slower assault pacing.  
**Tactical geometry:** Depot located in high-radiation service ring; repair teams work tethered in 9-minute exposure intervals; replacement shipments are 27–41 days out.  
**Emotional reversal:** Isaac chooses tempo loss over hospital drawdown, then absorbs blame from command cadre.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: assault window slips by 12 days. Delayed: civilian trust index rises in contested wards. Arc dependency: Book 8 condition #2 (sustainable corridors) met through restraint, not acceleration.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0440; mission chain `B8-S05`; logistics table lock.

### Packet B8-S06 — Broadcast Night of False Invasion
**Objective:** Defeat incumbent propaganda claiming coalition plans atmospheric depopulation strikes.  
**Conflict:** Coalition media wing proposes deepfake counter-propaganda mirroring enemy tactics.  
**Tactical geometry:** Asynchronous uplink architecture means no single synchronized truth-drop; evidence bundles propagate in staggered legal notarization waves.  
**Emotional reversal:** Lin rejects easy disinfo retaliation and commits to slower verified release chain even as panic spikes.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: panic crest reduced but not eliminated. Delayed: hostile broadcasters lose two neutral arbitration licenses. Arc dependency: preserves anti-monopoly legitimacy for Book 9 war-to-law transition announcement.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0445; mission chain `B8-S06`; media governance cross-link.

### Packet B8-S07 — Ascender Shaft Mass-Casualty Drill
**Objective:** Test whether Earth ascent/descent bottlenecks can absorb real campaign casualty loads.  
**Conflict:** Command wants optimistic throughput assumptions; medical planners insist on failure-mode rehearsal.  
**Tactical geometry:** Ascender cars capped by thermal cycling and structural stress timers; no surge beyond rated cadence without week-long downtime risk.  
**Emotional reversal:** Hale acknowledges published casualty model is wrong and signs a lower offensive tempo envelope.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: attack plan rewritten around medevac realism. Delayed: hawk bloc accuses leadership of paralysis. Arc dependency: prevents Branch D trigger via life-support-first seizure doctrine.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0450; mission chain `B8-S07`; reality-gate medical throughput lock.

### Packet B8-S08 — Threshold Vote at Dawn Meridian
**Objective:** Decide whether Book 8 handoff criteria are sufficient to launch Book 9 systems-seizure phase.  
**Conflict:** Split coalition: one bloc wants symbolic liberation date, another demands proof all three handoff conditions are auditable.  
**Tactical geometry:** Decision matrix built from delayed reports across six theaters; two corridors still have unresolved escort maintenance debt.  
**Emotional reversal:** Valerie supports postponement she privately hates after reviewing unresolved civilian corridor risk.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: launch delayed one cycle, unresolved corridors repaired. Delayed: adversary fortifies two kernel nodes. Arc dependency: Book 8 exits with verified civil partners, sustainable lanes, and signed ROE consensus.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0455; Book 8 handoff complete; mission chain `B8-S08`.

## BOOK 9 — *Seizure Without Ruin*

### Packet B9-S01 — Kernel Ring Breach Moratorium
**Objective:** Neutralize first control-kernel ring while preserving urban life-support continuity.  
**Conflict:** Fast strike package can collapse enemy command quickly but risks grid-wide oxygen outages.  
**Tactical geometry:** Orbital-ground command lag prevents fine-grain live retasking; breach teams run pre-scripted branch tables tied to sensor thresholds.  
**Emotional reversal:** Hale orders a slower compartmentalized breach and sacrifices chance to capture a top hardliner.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: kernel segment isolated, life-support continuity maintained. Delayed: hardliner escape fuels countervalue threats. Arc dependency: advances Book 9 condition #1 without violating #2.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0460; Book 9 row; mission chain `B9-S01`.

### Packet B9-S02 — Blackmail Clock in Ward 17
**Objective:** Defuse countervalue blackmail threat targeting three hospital districts.  
**Conflict:** Marko can prioritize neutralizing trigger team or evacuating wards with inadequate transport capacity.  
**Tactical geometry:** Elevation-layer transit grid bottlenecked by damaged magline; full evacuation requires 14 hours, trigger window 5 hours.  
**Emotional reversal:** Marko abandons pursuit fixation and diverts strike assets to shield corridor control for civilian evacuation.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: two wards cleared, one held in hardened shelter. Delayed: trigger team escapes into sewer lattice. Arc dependency: preserves governability threshold while increasing insurgency residue risk.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0465; mission chain `B9-S02`; Branch D risk-managed.

### Packet B9-S03 — Parliament of Broken Elevators
**Objective:** Reopen municipal services council under active shelling and infrastructural paralysis.  
**Conflict:** Isaac can force provisional technocrat board for speed or accept chaotic multiparty council with slower decisions.  
**Tactical geometry:** Vertical transport outages make quorum physically hard; delegates rotate through stairwell shelters with 0.3g injury constraints and fatigue collapse risk.  
**Emotional reversal:** Isaac yields chair authority to civilian stewards and becomes technical witness only.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: water ration protocol enacted lawfully, late by 9 hours. Delayed: legitimacy gain reduces sabotage recruiting in two districts. Arc dependency: supports Book 9 condition #2 and preps Book 10 authority drawdown.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0470; mission chain `B9-S03`; governance continuity link.

### Packet B9-S04 — Asterion Conditional Lift
**Objective:** Secure Asterion League emergency fabrication support without conceding monopoly privileges.  
**Conflict:** Asterion negotiators offer rapid Class-1 surge tied to broad immunity clauses.  
**Tactical geometry:** Fab surge requires transit-slot reallocation; each priority slot moved to Class-1 aid delays Class-2 local recovery kits.  
**Emotional reversal:** Lin rejects immunity demand, accepts smaller surge, and signs external audit hooks.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: aid volume lower but politically survivable. Delayed: local fab cooperatives remain viable instead of captured. Arc dependency: blocks Branch C-style recurrence during reconquest climax.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0475; mission chain `B9-S04`; fabrication ladder lock.

### Packet B9-S05 — Brother at the Escrow Vault
**Objective:** Resolve Valerie brother arc at a kernel escrow facility where he controls a kill-switch shard.  
**Conflict:** Valerie can execute immediate lethal stop or attempt negotiated surrender with uncertain timing.  
**Tactical geometry:** Vault approach through low-g maintenance crawl where crossfire risks puncturing coolant loops feeding district shelters.  
**Emotional reversal:** Valerie holsters and negotiates, extracting shard codes in exchange for public tribunal guarantee.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: kill-switch neutralized, brother captured alive. Delayed: coalition fractures over mercy optics. Arc dependency: fulfills Book 9 character delta lock while preserving Book 10 law-first settlement path.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0480; mission chain `B9-S05`; character arc linkage.

### Packet B9-S06 — Night of Twelve Microgrids
**Objective:** Keep minimum power across twelve urban microgrids during simultaneous sabotage.  
**Conflict:** Engineers propose blacking out contested zones to secure core districts.  
**Tactical geometry:** Grid coupling means dumping one zone can induce cascade faults; restart cycles are 6–18 hours each under spare-transformer scarcity.  
**Emotional reversal:** Hale accepts riskier distributed maintenance plan and deploys combat teams as line repair security instead of assault units.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: ten of twelve grids hold above collapse floor. Delayed: offensive timeline slips; civilian mortality curve stays below threshold. Arc dependency: reinforces Book 9 condition #2 and enables credible transition announcement.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0485; mission chain `B9-S06`; logistics realism lock.

### Packet B9-S07 — Law Clock Declaration
**Objective:** Announce binding war-to-law transition timeline before final kernel neutralization is complete.  
**Conflict:** Command advisers insist announcing early will telegraph weakness and invite last-ditch attacks.  
**Tactical geometry:** Multi-front operations force message relay through delayed, redundant notarization nodes to prevent spoof takeover.  
**Emotional reversal:** Lin and Hale jointly commit to sunset dates that limit their own emergency authority during unresolved combat.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: neutral civic blocs swing toward cooperation. Delayed: hardliner cells accelerate sabotage attempts before deadline. Arc dependency: satisfies Book 9 condition #3 credibility test.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0490; mission chain `B9-S07`; transition lock.

### Packet B9-S08 — Kernel Winter Ceasefire Window
**Objective:** Close Book 9 by escrow-neutralizing remaining kernel controls while holding civil-service continuity floor.  
**Conflict:** Final assault could end war faster but risks water/oxygen collapse in three megazones.  
**Tactical geometry:** Assault vectors constrained by frozen transit weather and orbital debris lanes; resupply cadence fixed, no miracle surge possible.  
**Emotional reversal:** Coalition accepts partial ceasefire corridor to finish escrow transfer safely.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: core kernels neutralized or escrowed; services remain above collapse threshold. Delayed: revanchist narrative shifts to “betrayal ceasefire.” Arc dependency: Book 9 handoff complete with all three dependency conditions met.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0495; Book 9 handoff complete; mission chain `B9-S08`.

## BOOK 10 — *Settlement Against Relapse*

### Packet B10-S01 — Emergency Keys Surrender Ceremony
**Objective:** Execute first mandatory transfer of emergency command keys out of protagonist control.  
**Conflict:** Security chiefs warn active cells make handoff premature and dangerous.  
**Tactical geometry:** Key shards distributed across latency-separated vaults; transfer requires synchronized attestations over delayed channels, creating sabotage windows.  
**Emotional reversal:** Hale signs handoff despite personal certainty he could run response faster himself.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: emergency authority narrows legally. Delayed: first response to fresh attack is slower but constitutional. Arc dependency: fulfills Book 10 protagonist drawdown lock.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0500; Book 10 row; mission chain `B10-S01`.

### Packet B10-S02 — Tribunal Overflow and Mercy Strike
**Objective:** Prevent tribunal collapse as caseload exceeds staffing by 4x.  
**Conflict:** Fast-track sentencing could clear backlog but violates due-process commitments.  
**Tactical geometry:** Detainee transport lanes and evidence archives are transit-limited; adding judges is month-scale due security vetting and travel lag.  
**Emotional reversal:** Valerie supports sentence deferments for low-level collaborators she once would have pursued aggressively.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: backlog stabilizes via triage tiers, not mass convictions. Delayed: victims’ groups protest leniency. Arc dependency: protects anti-relapse legitimacy against revenge capture dynamics.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0505; mission chain `B10-S02`; legal-process cross-link.

### Packet B10-S03 — FVB Reintegration Corridor Trial
**Objective:** Test reintegration corridor for non-principal FVB actors under monitored labor/service contracts.  
**Conflict:** Revanchists demand blanket suppression; economists warn suppression-only will regenerate piracy funnels.  
**Tactical geometry:** Corridor monitoring relies on sparse patrol fuel and delayed compliance reporting; no omnipresent enforcement mesh exists.  
**Emotional reversal:** Marko escorts first reintegration convoy himself, publicly owning risk and stigma.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: pilot cohort enters monitored programs, two abscond. Delayed: piracy incidents dip where recruitment funnels lose labor intake. Arc dependency: advances terminal legitimacy condition via dual-track accountability + reintegration.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0510; mission chain `B10-S03`; FVB strategy lock.

### Packet B10-S04 — Cognitive Rights Exception Hearing
**Objective:** Block security bloc attempt to codify broad cognitive-rights exceptions under perpetual emergency language.  
**Conflict:** Intelligence services claim only expansive exceptions can prevent kernel resurrection.  
**Tactical geometry:** Evidence streams arrive from six theaters with integrity lags; hearing cannot rely on live classified drops without chain break risk.  
**Emotional reversal:** Isaac testifies against tools he helped design, accepting diminished personal influence over future security doctrine.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: exception language narrowed with auto-sunset triggers. Delayed: intelligence chiefs leak criticism campaigns. Arc dependency: directly enforces Book 10 bounded-coercion requirement.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0515; mission chain `B10-S04`; constitutional lock.

### Packet B10-S05 — Treaty Trigger at Far Belt Relay
**Objective:** Prove dependency-treaty sanctions can constrain domestic power grabs without restarting total war.  
**Conflict:** Coalition insiders attempt illegal seizure of relay tax authority, expecting allies to ignore violation.  
**Tactical geometry:** Sanction enforcement rides slow inter-system finance rails; penalties bite in weeks, not hours, requiring political patience.  
**Emotional reversal:** Lin sanctions her own allied bloc to preserve treaty credibility.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: attempted grab stalls as insurers and fuel brokers freeze contracts. Delayed: coalition fractures harden but rules survive. Arc dependency: validates treaty enforceability in imperfect conditions.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0520; mission chain `B10-S05`; postwar treaty lock.

### Packet B10-S06 — Ombuds Net Under Cut Cables
**Objective:** Keep cross-theater ombuds network functioning during coordinated sabotage of communications trunks.  
**Conflict:** Security services propose temporary gag authority to stop panic rumors.  
**Tactical geometry:** Trunk outages push appeals to courier pods with 3–9 day latency; triage must prioritize life-critical rights petitions first.  
**Emotional reversal:** Hale rejects gag order and accepts reputational damage from slower, noisy transparency.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: ombuds throughput drops but remains lawful and visible. Delayed: trust erosion slows, then recovers as appeal outcomes publish. Arc dependency: supports terminal self-correction criterion over efficiency theater.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0525; mission chain `B10-S06`; oversight lock.

### Packet B10-S07 — Founder Exit Vote
**Objective:** Hold binding vote on protagonist withdrawal from permanent executive command.  
**Conflict:** Popular pressure calls for “temporary extension” of founder authority due ongoing instability.  
**Tactical geometry:** Vote integrity depends on distributed ledger attestations with delayed reconciliation, preventing instant victory claims.  
**Emotional reversal:** Public fear initially swings toward extension; survivor blocs reverse outcome after hearing rollback-risk testimony.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: extension fails; founders begin formal exit schedule. Delayed: short-term confidence dip in security markets. Arc dependency: fulfills identity closure as founders-who-step-back.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0530; mission chain `B10-S07`; character endgame lock.

### Packet B10-S08 — Imperfect Peace Stress Test
**Objective:** Validate terminal condition: system remains contestable and self-correcting despite coordinated crises.  
**Conflict:** Three simultaneous shocks (fuel strike, tribunal hack attempt, border raid rumor) test whether emergency recentralization returns.  
**Tactical geometry:** Crisis response unfolds under real transit delays and depleted reserve stocks; no actor can dominate all theaters instantly.  
**Emotional reversal:** Coalition accepts visible inefficiency and local failures rather than invoking unlimited central decree.  
**Consequence ledger:** Immediate: losses contained unevenly, no unilateral recapture achieved. Delayed: chronic low-grade instability persists with active correction pathways. Arc dependency: Book 10 terminal condition satisfied—imperfect but anti-relapse settlement holds.
**Continuity refs:** seq 0535; terminal condition met; mission chain `B10-S08`.

## Coverage Check (24 / 24)
- Book 8 packets: 8
- Book 9 packets: 8
- Book 10 packets: 8

All packets include tactical geometry, emotional reversal, and explicit consequence ledgers tied to Books 8–10 dependencies in the 10-book arc grid.

## Contradiction-Check Summary (Packet Set)
- Reality Gate constraints are explicit in every packet (anchoring, burn/heat limits, latency, finite logistics, fatigue, sensor uncertainty).
- No instant reinforcement, omniscient command, or zero-cost escalation claims introduced.
- Book 8 handoff criteria, Book 9 governability floor, and Book 10 anti-relapse constraints remain dependency-linked and auditable.
- Valerie brother arc resolves as political/moral decision path (not tactical shortcut), matching Book 9 dependency lock.
- FVB treatment remains dual-track: interdiction of principal terror actors plus monitored reintegration for non-principal cohorts.
- End-state is intentionally imperfect/self-correcting, avoiding clean-win relapse contradiction.
