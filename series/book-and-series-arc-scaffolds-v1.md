# Book + Series Arc Scaffolds v1

_Status: Structure scaffold aligned to hybrid episodic + macro spine_

## Series Spine (Macro)
- **Book 1:** Betrayal and survival break the illusion of command legitimacy.
- **Book 2:** Squad builds independent operational doctrine while hunted.
- **Book 3:** Information asymmetry war; expose contradictions in Consensus governance.
- **Book 4:** Coalition politics (Belt factions, defectors, internal fractures).
- **Book 5:** Contest for post-control order: what replaces Consensus and steward monopoly.

## Book 1 Scaffold — Working Title: _Ashes of Extraction_

### Episodic Promise
A marine squad sent on a high-risk extraction realizes they were designed to die once useful.

### Arc Skeleton
1. **Incitement:** inbound to Belt op under-equipped and politically expendable.
2. **Early Proof of Skill:** squad executes with high competence despite constraints.
3. **Midpoint Corruption Reveal:** databank raid moral injury + command narrative mismatch.
4. **Betrayal Confirmation:** extraction truth and disposal authorization overheard.
5. **Climax:** external intervention + blackfly escape under nuclear kill-box pressure.
6. **Aftermath Hook:** squad survives but becomes operationally unplaceable—too informed to reintegrate.

### Character Turns (Book 1 required)
- Hale: obedience -> conditional obedience.
- Valerie: reflexive rage -> first intentional restraint + reveal setup.
- Isaac: reactive hacker -> proactive counter-surveillance architect.
- Marko: tactical brute -> survivability engineer authority.
- Lin: intuition support -> mission-critical decision voice.

### Continuity Hook to Book 2
Recovered payload includes partial archive proving strategic manipulation and class-tier medicine/compute controls.

## Book 2 Scaffold — Working Title: _Dead Channels_

### Episodic Promise
Cut off from lawful command support, the squad must survive through improvised alliances while both regime and locals test their legitimacy.

### Arc Skeleton
1. **Incitement:** supply denial and kill/capture directives circulate through official channels.
2. **Alliance Market:** broker negotiations, conditional harbor, trade-for-protection episodes.
3. **Internal Stressor:** unresolved trauma and authority style conflicts degrade team cohesion.
4. **Midpoint:** brother-figure pre-reveal intervention confirms inside-source reality.
5. **Climax:** choose between high-value strategic objective and extraction of a human bond asset.
6. **Aftermath Hook:** source survives at cost; anti-Consensus proof expands.

### Continuity Hook to Book 3
Evidence points toward Class-1/2 control infrastructure and operational nodes tied to steward security architecture.

---

## Book 3 Scaffold — Working Title: _Monopoly of Safety_

### Episodic Promise
The team executes targeted operations to break the regime’s narrative monopoly while evading precision retaliation.

### Arc Skeleton
1. **Incitement:** counterintelligence sweep starts erasing witnesses and logs.
2. **Campaign Pattern:** hit-and-fade data seizures + authenticity verification battles.
3. **Midpoint:** major proof obtained, but release route compromised.
4. **Climax:** synchronized physical + information strike preserving both lives and evidence credibility.
5. **Aftermath Hook:** fractures emerge inside steward hierarchy.

### Continuity Hook to Book 4+
Not just overthrow question now—governance replacement question arrives before victory.

## Series-Level Character Arc Scaffolds
- **Hale:** burdened protector -> deliberate civic leader.
- **Valerie:** controlled fury -> command-grade precision protector.
- **Isaac:** isolated systems ghost -> trusted architect of collective strategy.
- **Marko:** blunt-force fixer -> disciplined builder of resilient infrastructure.
- **Lin:** empathic warning system -> bounded strategist who can hold conflict.

## Tactical/Emotional Turning Point Design Rules
1. Every major tactical win must cost something relational or moral.
2. Every emotional breakthrough must change later tactical behavior.
3. At least one core pair relationship should materially shift per book.
4. Ending hooks should open exactly one dominant forward question, not many.
