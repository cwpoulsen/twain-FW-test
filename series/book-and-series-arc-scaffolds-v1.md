## Book 1 Scaffold — Working Title: _Ashes of Extraction_

### Episodic Promise
A marine squad sent on a high-risk extraction realizes they were designed to die once useful.

### Arc Skeleton
1. **Incitement:** inbound to Belt op under-equipped and politically expendable.
2. **Early Proof of Skill:** squad executes with high competence despite constraints.
3. **Betrayal Confirmation:** extraction truth and disposal authorization overheard.
4. **Climax:** external intervention + Blackfly escape under nuclear kill-box pressure.
5. **Second-Act Moral Corrosion:** later free-team databank raid succeeds tactically but poisons squad psychology.
6. **Aftermath Hook:** squad survives but becomes operationally unplaceable—too informed to reintegrate.

### Character Turns (Book 1 required)
- Hale: obedience -> conditional obedience.
- Valerie: reflexive rage -> first intentional restraint + ambiguous inside-source signal seed (full reveal deferred to Book 2).
- Isaac: reactive hacker -> proactive counter-surveillance architect.
- Marko: tactical brute -> survivability engineer authority.
- Lin: intuition support -> mission-critical decision voice.

### Continuity Hook to Book 2
Recovered payload includes partial archive proving strategic manipulation and class-tier medicine/compute controls, plus a boxed **new AI seed/system** that re-weights every factional objective.

---

## Book 2 Scaffold — Working Title: _Dead Channels_

### Episodic Promise
Cut off from lawful command support, the squad must survive through improvised alliances while both regime and locals test their legitimacy.

### Arc Skeleton
1. **Incitement:** supply denial and kill/capture directives circulate through official channels.
2. **Alliance Market:** broker negotiations, conditional harbor, trade-for-protection episodes.
3. **Internal Stressor:** unresolved trauma and authority style conflicts degrade team cohesion.
4. **Midpoint:** brother-figure pre-reveal intervention confirms inside-source reality.
5. **Climax:** choose between high-value strategic objective and extraction of a human bond asset.
6. **Aftermath Hook:** source survives at cost; anti-Consensus proof expands.

### Continuity Hook to Book 3
Evidence points toward Class-1/2 control infrastructure and operational nodes tied to steward security architecture.

---

## Book 3 Scaffold — Working Title: _Monopoly of Safety_

### Episodic Promise
The team executes targeted operations to break the regime’s narrative monopoly while evading precision retaliation.

### Arc Skeleton
1. **Incitement:** counterintelligence sweep starts erasing witnesses and logs.
2. **Campaign Pattern:** hit-and-fade data seizures + authenticity verification battles.
3. **Midpoint:** major proof obtained, but release route compromised.
4. **Climax:** synchronized physical + information strike preserving both lives and evidence credibility.
5. **Aftermath Hook:** fractures emerge inside steward hierarchy.

### Continuity Hook to Book 4+
Not just overthrow question now—governance replacement question arrives before victory.

---

## Series-Level Character Arc Scaffolds
- **Hale:** burdened protector -> deliberate civic leader.
- **Valerie:** controlled fury -> command-grade precision protector.
- **Isaac:** isolated systems ghost -> trusted architect of collective strategy.
- **Marko:** blunt-force fixer -> disciplined builder of resilient infrastructure.
- **Lin:** empathic warning system -> bounded strategist who can hold conflict.

---

## Tactical/Emotional Turning Point Design Rules
1. Every major tactical win must cost something relational or moral.
2. Every emotional breakthrough must change later tactical behavior.
3. At least one core pair relationship should materially shift per book.
4. Ending hooks should open exactly one dominant forward question, not many.

## Consequence Pass Addendum — Non-Reversible Arc Costs

### Book 1 -> Book 2 Carryover Costs
- Databank success brands squad as strategic threat, collapsing any plausible amnesty track.
- Psychological corrosion from B1 lethal-call events reduces trust elasticity during B2 alliance negotiations.
- Early proof chain forces adversaries to adopt witness-erasure doctrine sooner than planned.

### Book 2 -> Book 3 Carryover Costs
- Saving source/human bond asset over pure strategic optimization preserves conscience but burns covert channels.
- Conditional Belt alliances create debt obligations callable at worst possible timings in B3.
- Valerie restraint choices improve command reliability but increase internal pressure when facing brother-linked operations.

### Book 3 -> Book 4 Carryover Costs
- Evidence victories fracture monopoly legitimacy without producing immediate replacement institutions.
- Counterintelligence war normalizes emergency measures across all sides, shrinking civil-liberty baseline entering transition.
- Infrastructure-linked strikes degrade both regime control and civilian service confidence, raising reconstruction burden.

### Book 4 -> Book 5 Carryover Costs
- Coalition bargaining requires moral compromise records becoming public; leadership credibility is partially pre-spent before settlement implementation.
- Anti-predation/security centralization tools needed for stabilization risk recreating smaller-scale versions of prior control abuses.
- Any constitutional settlement that moves too fast triggers supply panic; too slow triggers militia entrepreneurship.


## Series Destabilizer Thread — Freed Voider Bands (FVB)
- Ex-EDF rejected populations form pirate/mercenary ecosystems across outer-system lanes.
- Their existence should pressure protagonists away from binary “regime vs resistance” framing and into governance triage.
- Strategic reveal: Consensus exploited release patterns to manufacture chronic insecurity and justify emergency doctrine persistence.
- Required consequence rule: anti-FVB operations that ignore reintegration economics increase next-cycle recruitment.
