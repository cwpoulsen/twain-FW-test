# Books 1–4 Mission Bank Integration Notes v2

Purpose: bind `ops/books1-4-mission-scenario-bank-v1.md` seeds to book arcs without continuity drift, tone flattening, or lock breakage.

Authority anchors:
- `series/book-and-series-arc-scaffolds-v1.md`
- `timeline/books1-4-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`
- `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`

## Book-by-Book Selection Intent

### Book 1 — Betrayal / Survival Ignition
- Pull mostly from **B1-01..B1-10**.
- Select at least one seed where tactical success permanently alters squad SOP.
- Ensure one mission visibly proves that “command rescue” is a false premise.

### Book 2 — Alliance / Provenance War
- Pull mostly from **B2-01..B2-10**.
- Include one operation where winning the fight worsens coalition legitimacy metrics.
- Tie at least one mission debrief to evidence-chain durability (not just kill-count outcome).

### Book 3 — Counterintel Fracture
- Pull mostly from **B3-01..B3-10**.
- Every selected mission must create institutional aftershock (policy, court, queue, or faction discipline consequence).
- Integrate FVB destabilizer pressure as a background force that alters convoy and trust decisions.

### Book 4 — Transition Governance Crisis
- Pull mostly from **B4-01..B4-10**.
- Endgame missions must test enforceable limits on new coalition power.
- Include one mission where anti-predation action risks reproducing Steward coercive methods.

## Draft-Pass Selection Pattern (Required)
For each book pass:
1. Select **5 primary + 3 reserve** seeds.
2. Place each seed against sequence windows in `timeline/books1-4-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`.
3. Confirm one mission per act foregrounds each lens:
   - logistics survivability
   - legitimacy/provenance
   - relationship fracture
4. In chapter debriefs, state explicit trade: **strategic gain -> moral or continuity cost**.

---

## Continuity Safeguards
- New tech capability claims must reconcile with class locks (`tech/fabricator-classes.md`, `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`).
- Faction doctrine changes must patch `factions/factions-doctrine-ledger-v1.md` in same pass.
- Any resolved “controlled unknown” must be downgraded/removed from canon-tracking files.
- Preserve acquisition split: AI seed/system in opening extraction; databank later provides training/provenance uplift.

## Fast Rejection Tests (Use Before Scene Drafting)
Reject a seed selection if it:
1. Solves a strategic problem without fuel, time, custody, or political cost.
2. Treats FVB pressure as one-off piracy instead of persistent recruitment ecology.
3. Grants protagonists omniscient targeting on unknown-position adversaries.
4. Produces a clean victory with no downstream legal, social, or maintenance consequences.
