# Books 1–4 Mission Bank Integration Notes v1

Purpose: connect `ops/books1-4-mission-scenario-bank-v1.md` to book-level arc scaffolds so seeds can be selected without breaking continuity.

## Book-by-Book Use Guidance

- **Book 1:** prioritize B1-01..B1-10 for betrayal/survival + moral corrosion. At least one mission should permanently alter squad doctrine.
- **Book 2:** prioritize B2-01..B2-10 for alliance-market politics and trust attrition. Use at least one seed where tactical success worsens coalition legitimacy.
- **Book 3:** prioritize B3-01..B3-10 for authenticity warfare and steward fracture. Every selected mission should include an institutional consequence, not just battlefield result.
- **Book 4:** prioritize B4-01..B4-10 for transition governance and enforceable compromise. Endgame missions should test auditable power limits.

## Selection Pattern (Recommended)

For each book draft pass:
1. Pick 5 primary seeds + 3 reserve seeds.
2. Confirm timeline placement against `timeline/books1-4-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`.
3. Ensure one mission per act centers each of: logistics, legitimacy, and relationship fracture.
4. Keep “strategic gain -> moral/continuity cost” explicit in chapter debriefs.

## Continuity Safeguards

- If a seed introduces new tech capability, reconcile with `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §5 before drafting scenes.
- If a seed alters faction doctrine, patch `factions/factions-doctrine-ledger-v1.md` immediately.
- If a seed resolves a controlled unknown, remove or downgrade that unknown in canon files.
