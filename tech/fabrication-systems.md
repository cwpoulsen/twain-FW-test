# Fabrication Systems Architecture (FW Canon)

## Purpose in Setting
The strategic center of gravity in *Fabrication Wars* is not raw territory, but **throughput authority**: who can convert feedstock, energy, and validated design authority into battlefield-capable assets fastest. Fabrication systems are therefore a sovereign function equivalent to navy + treasury + armory in pre-fabrication eras.

## Core Fabrication Stack

### 1. Feedstock Intake Layer
**Function:** Ingest ore, scrap, atmospheric gases, bioslurry, and reclaimed composites.

**Subcomponents**
- **Molecular sorting vaults**: Separate contaminants down to isotopic bands.
- **Catalytic cracking arrays**: Break polymers and organics into reusable monomers.
- **Rare-earth concentration beds**: High-value bottleneck processing.

**Hard constraints**
- Water and hydrogen balance limits continuous output on dry worlds.
- Isotopic impurity above 0.8% dramatically increases failure rates in high-stress weapon parts.
- Contaminated battlefield salvage can carry hostile nanite residues requiring quarantine burn cycles.

### 2. Energy Conversion Layer
**Function:** Deliver stable power envelopes for additive, subtractive, biofab, and lattice growth processes.

**Generation profiles**
- **Microfusion toroids**: High output, strategic targets, fuel logistics burden.
- **Fission salt stacks**: Slower startup, robust under siege, politically sensitive.
- **Solar sail fields + supercap farms**: Quiet signatures, weather/orbital dependence.

**Operational note:** Throughput collapses are typically energy-envelope failures before feedstock exhaustion; power governance determines war tempo.

### 3. Design Authority Layer (DAL)
**Function:** Verify blueprint integrity, cryptographic signing, and legal/strategic release permissions.

**Governance elements**
- **Template Lineage Registry (TLR)** for provenance.
- **Combat Release Keys (CRKs)** requiring command quorum.
- **Failsafe envelope tags** preventing unauthorized over-performance variants.

**Primary vulnerability:** DAL compromise allows hidden defects, remote kill conditions, or adversary telemetry implants at scale.

### 4. Fabrication Execution Layer
**Function:** Physical manufacturing and assembly.

**Modes**
- **Macro-additive chassis printing** (armor hulls, drone frames)
- **Micro-lattice growth** (lightweight structural internals)
- **Precision machining cells** (barrels, seals, bearings)
- **Biofab pods** (medic tissue, symbiotic interfaces)

### 5. Validation & Hardening Layer
**Function:** Stress testing, quantum scan inspection, EMI hardening, and field certification.

**Doctrine impact:** Factions with strict validation have slower first-wave output but lower attrition over campaigns >90 days.

## Strategic Control Concepts

### Throughput Sovereignty
A polity is sovereign only if it controls at least one end-to-end fabrication chain that is not externally key-gated. Outsourced DAL is equivalent to foreign command of one’s arsenal.

### Blue Delay
The delay between approved design and deployable production lot. Blue Delay under 6 hours enables tactical adaptation; over 48 hours locks doctrine into static attritional patterns.

### Ghost Capacity
Hidden reserve output that can be activated through dormant lines, dark depots, and civilian line conversion. Essential for strategic surprise.

## Typical Campaign Phases and Fabrication Behavior

1. **Shaping (Pre-open conflict)**
   - Cyber probes against DAL and logistics ERP nodes.
   - Market manipulation of rare-earth futures to induce feedstock scarcity.
2. **Shock (First 10 days)**
   - Long-range strikes on fusion toroids and rail hubs.
   - Rapid release of pre-signed emergency templates.
3. **Grinding Exchange (30–180 days)**
   - Salvage wars; battlefield wreckage becomes feedstock terrain.
   - Counterfitted template proliferation (quality collapse risk).
4. **Breakpoint / Settlement**
   - One side loses DAL trust or energy stability.
   - Mutiny and regional defections often begin at fabricator queue starvation.

## Key Vulnerability Matrix

| Attack Surface | Immediate Effect | Delayed Effect | Countermeasure |
|---|---|---|---|
| DAL key theft | Unauthorized production | Fleet-wide latent defects | Quorum rotation + air-gapped signing |
| Feedstock contamination | Batch scrap spikes | Chronic fatigue failures | Multi-stage assay + quarantine loops |
| Power pulse attack | Production halt | Thermal stress damage | Segmentable grids + inertial buffering |
| Logistics node sabotage | Queue starvation | Regional political fracture | Distributed depots + autonomous routing |
| Validation bypass | Fast surge output | Catastrophic combat breakdown | Randomized destructive testing |
