# Fabricator Class Taxonomy (Coherence Pass 1)

Status: **Canon-aligned reference**  
Authority: `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` section 5 + `tech/technical-architecture-v1.md` section 3.

This file resolves prior class-number drift. Class labels are now strictly **Class 4 -> Class 1** (high access to highest restriction).

## 1) Canon Class Definitions (Locked)

### Class 4 — Industrial Backbone
**Access:** Broad (civil + military)  
**Primary outputs:** hull structures, composites, wiring harnesses, pressure frames, mechanical assemblies.

**Role in war and economy**
- Keeps habitats sealed, ships flying, and heavy infrastructure recoverable.
- Dominates maintenance throughput and post-strike rebuild tempo.

**Hard limits**
- Cannot produce top-tier compute chips or strategic molecular products.
- Precision tolerance falls off for ultra-high-stress or nanoscale components.

---

### Class 3 — General Electronics Tier
**Access:** Broad but monitored  
**Primary outputs:** mainstream electronics, sensors, control boards, displays, basic logic ICs.

**Role in war and economy**
- Enables drones, comms gear, field diagnostics, and everyday industrial controls.
- Provides the electronics floor for almost all Belt self-sufficiency.

**Hard limits**
- Excludes advanced microprocessor node capability.
- Cannot replace Earth-controlled Class 2 compute/material bottlenecks.

---

### Class 2 — Strategic Precision Tier
**Access:** Tightly controlled (primarily Earth-governed)  
**Primary outputs:** advanced chips, molecular-fab medicines, strategic superconductive materials, high-end sensor and reactor components.

**Role in war and economy**
- Core leverage layer in Earth-Belt dependency.
- Sets ceiling for autonomous military modernization by non-Earth actors.

**Hard limits / governance constraints**
- DAL and release-key controls are treated as sovereignty instruments.
- Queue access often functions as political reward/punishment.

---

### Class 1 — AGI Bottleneck Tier
**Access:** Black-tier secret  
**Primary outputs:** quantum compute chip fabric capable of supporting AGI-class systems.

**Role in regime continuity**
- Maintains Consensus monopoly on high-end intelligence substrate.
- Central to anti-peer-AGI doctrine.

**Hard limits / structural facts**
- Class 1 can only replicate Class 1.
- Site locations, redundancy topology, and operator chain remain compartmented.

## 2) Deployment Forms (Non-Class Labels)

To preserve prior useful detail without class confusion, deployment language is now separated from class labels:

- **Field Stitch Packages**: front-line repair modules, usually Class 4/3-capable.
- **Mobile Forge Carriers**: convoy fabrication stacks, typically Class 4 with selective Class 3.
- **Theater Foundry Complexes**: fixed large-scale production, mainly Class 4/3; occasionally licensed Class 2 enclaves.
- **Orbital Seed Yards**: microgravity ship/module production; class mix depends on political control.
- **Sovereign Integrated Arrays**: governance-level networks coordinating all available classes under one command regime.

These are operational topologies, not alternate class names.

---

## 3) Interoperability and Failure Rules

1. **Template trust is decisive.** Compatible schema beats identical hardware.
2. **Validation debt is cumulative.** Class 4/3 surge without Class 2-grade QA creates delayed catastrophic failures.
3. **Energy/coolant remain universal chokepoints.** Feedstock workarounds cannot fully substitute power stability.
4. **Governance is a technical dependency.** Production collapses when release authority fragments.

---

## 4) Story Constraints to Reuse

- Belt actors can often sustain war with Class 4/3 improvisation, but struggle to scale precision dependence without Class 2 access.
- Earth can win queue wars without major fleet action by throttling Class 2 outputs.
- Any credible threat to Class 1 secrecy escalates immediately to existential-level policy response.
