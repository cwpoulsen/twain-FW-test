## Class-0: Field Stitchers ("Stitch")
**Mass:** 40–250 kg  
**Crew:** 0–2 operators  
**Output:** Consumables, patches, sensor housings, drone micro-parts

**Capabilities**
- Near-frontline repair and adaptation.
- Converts scavenged polymers and light metals quickly.
- Can print mission-specific connectors/adapters within minutes.

**Constraints**
- Cannot produce pressure-rated weapon cores or precision barrels.
- Strong dependence on validated template libraries.
- High misprint rate under dust/radiation without clean tents.

**Logistics profile**
- Feedstock: cartridge canisters + salvage chips.
- Power: battery/microcell; vulnerable to cold-weather efficiency loss.

**Vulnerabilities**
- Easy to spoof with poisoned templates.
- EM bursts can desynchronize calibrations.

**Tactical implication**
- Units with Stitch density recover combat power between engagements 2–3x faster.
- Encourages decentralized initiative but increases template discipline burden.

## Class-I: Mobile Forge Carriers ("Forgevan")
**Mass:** 8–40 tons  
**Crew:** 6–24  
**Output:** Light vehicles, drone swarms, crew-served weapon assemblies

**Capabilities**
- Brigade-level sustainment and adaptation.
- Integrated assay + print + basic QA chain.
- Can refit captured enemy platforms into own logistics ecosystem.

**Constraints**
- Throughput bottlenecked by precision machining modules.
- Signature-heavy; thermal output exposes location.
- Requires protected queue windows for high-complexity builds.

**Logistics profile**
- Needs convoyed feedstock bricks and coolant.
- Typical endurance: 7–12 days independent, then resupply.

**Vulnerabilities**
- Ambush priority target; destruction has disproportionate morale effect.
- Internal sabotage risk from contractor specialists.

**Tactical implication**
- Enables maneuver warfare away from fixed depots.
- Loss forces reversion to static supply lines within ~72 hours.

## Class-II: Theater Foundries ("Bastion Fabs")
**Mass:** 20k–200k tons equivalent infrastructure  
**Crew:** 2,000–15,000 mixed civilian/military  
**Output:** Mainline armor, missiles, reactor components, replacement hull sections

**Capabilities**
- Sustained campaign production across multiple corps.
- Multi-material mastery including ceramics, smart foams, and lattice alloys.
- Own DAL mirror nodes with regional authority.

**Constraints**
- Long setup time; geologically dependent for heat sink and resource flow.
- Politically visible; often tied to local labor compacts.
- Vulnerable to legal strikes if civilian ownership is mixed.

**Logistics profile**
- Rail/orbital elevator/sea-route dependent.
- Consumes extraordinary coolant and shielding material.

**Vulnerabilities**
- Kinetic strikes, cyber infiltration, labor unrest.
- Queue attacks (false high-priority jobs) can silently cripple output.

**Tactical implication**
- Theater with surviving Bastion Fabs wins wars of duration.
- Their loss forces strategic withdrawal or external dependency.

## Class-III: Orbital Seed Yards ("Seedyards")
**Mass:** Modular 5k–80k tons  
**Crew:** 300–2,000 + autonomous tenders  
**Output:** Escorts, station modules, atmospheric drop-frames, long-burn logistics craft

**Capabilities**
- Manufactures in microgravity for superior lattice quality.
- Rapid deployment of prefabricated orbital infrastructure.
- Supports planetary blockade and deep-route interdiction.

**Constraints**
- Requires secure launch/transfer chain.
- High latency to ground tactical needs unless drop network intact.
- Dependent on orbital debris management.

**Logistics profile**
- Feedstock from asteroid tow, orbital salvage, or launch mass.
- Energy via solar arrays + fusion cores.

**Vulnerabilities**
- Orbital denial weapons and debris storms.
- Docking software compromise can trigger cascading collisions.

**Tactical implication**
- Side with Seedyard advantage dictates strategic mobility and reinforcement tempo.

## Class-IV: Sovereign Genesis Arrays ("Genesis")
**Mass:** Continent-scale distributed network  
**Crew:** Nation-state institutional control  
**Output:** End-to-end military ecosystem including DAL-authorized doctrine variants

**Capabilities**
- Simultaneous production across all warfare domains.
- Autonomous design iteration with human command checkpoints.
- Can regenerate destroyed industrial baselines in months, not decades.

**Constraints**
- Governance complexity; command legitimacy is a technical dependency.
- Requires stable legal regime around template rights.
- Political fear of overcentralized control invites sabotage coalitions.

**Logistics profile**
- Integrates civilian economy with wartime conversion protocols.
- Strategic reserves measured in time-to-rebuild rather than stockpile tonnage.

**Vulnerabilities**
- Civil war risk if CRK quorums fracture.
- AI alignment drift in optimization layers can privilege throughput over safety.

**Tactical implication**
- Genesis-capable factions can absorb catastrophic losses and continue offensive operations.
- Defeating Genesis requires governance disruption, not just kinetic destruction.

## Cross-Class Interoperability Rules
1. **Template compatibility > hardware compatibility.** Shared schema permits coalition production despite different machines.
2. **Validation debt accumulates silently.** Surging Class-0/1 output without Class-II QA causes delayed combat failures.
3. **Energy and coolant are universal choke points.** Feedstock substitution is easier than power substitution.
4. **Human trust is a hard dependency.** Operators will bypass safeguards under pressure; doctrine must anticipate this.

## Canon Hooks for Story Operations
- Mutiny trigger: command diverts coolant from civilian grids to Class-II military lines during heatwave.
- Covert ops objective: inject counterfeit calibration package into Forgevan fleet before offensive.
- Strategic plot turn: Seedyard debris cascade traps relief fleet, isolating a colony theater.
