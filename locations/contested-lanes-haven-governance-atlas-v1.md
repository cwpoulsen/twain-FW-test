# Contested Lanes, Havens, and Exile Corridor Governance Atlas v1

Scope: location-centric governance and adjudication architecture.

## Contested Lane Typology and Governance Burden
Lane classes map enforcement and rights burden, not just transit geometry: Type A (arterial continuity), Type B (integrity/witness protection), Type C (rights-floor exile corridors), Type D (surge authority clarity).

## Haven Stations as Provisional Municipalities
Havens are modular municipalities: service trinity boards (air/water, food, safety-adjudication), mixed representation, and asynchronous claim kiosks.

## Checkpoint Constellations and Adjudication Flow
Constellations use shared matrices + local adaptation fields; deviations must be logged and reviewable.

## Exile Corridors and Non-Return Populations
Rights-floor zones require emergency life-support guarantees, non-extortion registration, and mediation teams that issue interim agreements.

## Salvage Fields, Wreck Rights, and Environmental Duty
Rescue-first precedence, layered ownership tests, contamination controls, and hazard-externality penalties.

## Reconciled Modules (de-duplicated)
### Dockyard Courtrooms and Mobile Hearing Geometry
Portable hearings with evidence capsules, translator access, and reversible interim orders.

### Relief Corridor Cartography and Seasonal Stress
Dynamic corridor maps with seasonal risk overlays and protected reroute triggers.

### Micro-Habitats, Air Commons, and Utility Politics
Utility governance separates life-support minimums from discretionary pricing.

### Memorial Sites, Missing Persons Walls, and Civic Memory
Missing-person registries and memorial governance as anti-disappearance legitimacy infrastructure.

### Interlingua Signage Systems for Multi-Origin Populations
Multilingual icon standards and low-literacy legal access surfaces.

### Location Design Checklist for Continuity-Safe Scenes
Every location packet includes delay envelope, enforcement capacity, rights clocks, and failure fallback.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Lane classes include comms delay and finite enforcement.
- Exile corridor policy aligns with EDF release/banishment + FVB destabilizer lock.
- Salvage law remains rescue-first with hazard accountability.
- Procedures preserve reversible decisions under uncertainty.
