# Post-Conflict Recovery Institutions Gazetteer v1

This gazetteer catalogs outer-system institutions designed to prevent relapse into convoy predation and legitimacy collapse.

## 1. Vesta Claims Reconciliation Hub

Mandate: absorb one category of post-conflict harm and convert it into a governed process with deadlines, evidentiary standards, and appeals. These institutions are intentionally redundant; redundancy is resilience when sabotage and latency are normal.

- Institutional protocol 1: intake teams classify claim urgency, verify identity under degraded records, and publish queue forecasts tied to real fabrication and transport capacity. Priority shifts are logged with machine-readable justifications to limit patronage capture.

- Institutional protocol 2: intake teams classify claim urgency, verify identity under degraded records, and publish queue forecasts tied to real fabrication and transport capacity. Priority shifts are logged with machine-readable justifications to limit patronage capture.

- Institutional protocol 3: intake teams classify claim urgency, verify identity under degraded records, and publish queue forecasts tied to real fabrication and transport capacity. Priority shifts are logged with machine-readable justifications to limit patronage capture.

- Institutional protocol 4: intake teams classify claim urgency, verify identity under degraded records, and publish queue forecasts tied to real fabrication and transport capacity. Priority shifts are logged with machine-readable justifications to limit patronage capture.

- Institutional protocol 5: intake teams classify claim urgency, verify identity under degraded records, and publish queue forecasts tied to real fabrication and transport capacity. Priority shifts are logged with machine-readable justifications to limit patronage capture.

- Institutional protocol 2: intake teams classify claim urgency, verify identity under degraded records, and publish queue forecasts tied to real fabrication and transport capacity. Priority shifts are logged with machine-readable justifications to limit patronage capture.

Failure pressure: organized intermediaries attempt to monetize queue access. Countermeasure: randomized audit overlays, external observers from rotating municipal compacts, and protected whistle routes with relocation support.
