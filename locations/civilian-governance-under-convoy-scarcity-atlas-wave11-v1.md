# Civilian Governance Under Convoy Scarcity Atlas — Wave 11

Status: Location-domain expansion focused on scarcity constitutions, legitimacy retention, and convoy-era civil administration.

## Location 1: Crown-of-Ash Habitat Ring

### Governance Under Convoy Scarcity
Crown-of-Ash Habitat Ring runs a ration constitution that ranks shipments by survival criticality: atmosphere chemistry, potable recovery, infection control, then caloric staples. Councils publish queue math daily because secrecy accelerates panic markets. Even so, each missed convoy arrival forces discretionary triage where elected stewards choose which district experiences brownout or food dilution.

### Administrative Stress Pattern
Administrators must arbitrate between legal fairness and operational feasibility. Families demand equal shares; engineers require concentrated inputs to prevent total systems collapse. When scarcity deepens, councils shift from entitlement language to labor-linked access bands, rewarding maintenance crews and med responders with stability credits. This keeps infrastructure alive but risks caste hardening and insurgent propaganda.

### Security and Social Legitimacy
FVB recruiters target dock workers who see high-value cargo moving past empty neighborhood depots. To blunt this, local governance charters require convoy transparency boards with civilian observers, delayed-release manifests, and public grievance windows. Security teams are forbidden from mass sweeps unless sabotage thresholds are met, because indiscriminate force historically converts neutral residents into lane-smuggling auxiliaries.

### Adjudication Interface
When cargo claims conflict—municipal requisition vs private contract vs wartime hold—Crown-of-Ash Habitat Ring uses provisional lane courts linked to contested-lane precedents. Judges issue temporary possession orders limited by expiry clocks so cargo keeps moving while liability is litigated later. This design reflects Reality Gate constraints: delayed justice is accepted, dead habitats are not.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Civilian administration modeled with hard logistics limits and lane-time uncertainty.
- Governance outcomes include fatigue, morale, and infrastructure costs; no frictionless policy wins.
- Asterion/Steward naming and power geometry aligned with locked canon vocabulary.
- FVB pressure integrated as chronic ecological destabilizer, not one-off antagonist event.
