## 1) Usage Notes

This pack provides diegetic artifacts that make institutions and conflict feel lived-in rather than abstract. Use them to:
- Anchor policy impacts in daily routines.
- Show class and jurisdiction differences without exposition dumps.
- Convey trust breakdowns via small language and ritual shifts.
- Surface continuity locks (coercive compliance, exile pathways, latency, FVB risk) through ordinary life details.

Artifacts are intentionally mixed: official forms, household norms, dock signage, memorial practices, school prompts, black-market vernacular, and veteran coping scripts.

## 2) Earth Core Urban Artifacts

### 2.1 Queue Courtesy Placard (Public Clinic)

> **FAIR ACCESS IS SOCIAL STABILITY**  
> Your wait position reflects real-time care equity priorities.  
> Do not solicit unofficial queue acceleration services.  
> Report anomalies through approved channels.

**Interpretive note:** “Care equity priorities” is widely understood to include compliance and reliability scores, though never stated on placards.

### 2.2 Household Link Hygiene Broadcast Script

Nightly municipal stream includes a two-minute segment reminding residents to complete “cognitive maintenance sync” before sleep, framed as civic courtesy for system efficiency.

### 2.3 School Civics Prompt (Age 12)

“Why do responsible societies prefer verified guidance over rumor?” Students write essays connecting personal freedom to shared safety obligations.

### 2.4 Rental Contract Clause Fragment

> Tenant acknowledges continuity-service eligibility depends on lawful identity and safety compliance status. Landlord bears no liability for continuity-related service interruptions.

**Texture function:** The regime’s control doctrine appears in banal contracts, not only in police scenes.

**Authority citations:** `canon/earth-consensus-daily-life-and-legal-architecture-v1.md`; `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §§3–4; `canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md` (OCC/DLCS-adjacent behavior).

---

## 3) Belt Habitat Artifacts

### 3.1 Dockside Chalkboard Code (Rotating)

Short symbols indicate practical realities:
- Spiral mark: air scrubber drift; bring independent filter if visiting.
- Two bars: warrant dispute active; expect long docking checks.
- Broken circle: convoy loss in last cycle; spare ration rules in effect.

### 3.2 Mutual Aid Receipt Stub

Handwritten and digitally mirrored receipt includes items lent, expected return window, and “weathered mercy” checkbox indicating debt forgiveness due to emergency.

### 3.3 Galley Wall Rule (Community Kitchen)

“Eat first, argue after pressure check.” A ritual phrase reminding people to stabilize survival basics before politics.

### 3.4 Harbor Oath Fragment

Dock workers repeat: “Hands visible, lines clean, records mirrored.” The oath fuses safety, anti-theft norms, and archive integrity culture.

**Authority citations:** `locations/belt-culture-zones-and-exile-corridors-v1.md`; `canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md` (BMAX, CSTN, ITAS); `tech/operational-logistics.md`.

---

## 4) Exile Corridor and Veteran Artifacts

### 4.1 Release Packet Envelope Stamp

“CIVIL STATUS RESTORED — EARTH ENTRY PROHIBITED.”  
Veterans often keep the envelope as proof and wound; it appears in family shrines and rage rituals.

### 4.2 Cheap Neuro-Soothe Patch Branding

Marketed as “Quiet Sleep for Hard Systems,” understood as post-module symptom management for ex-marines with no formal care access.

### 4.3 Corridor Bar Toast

“To five years and no map home.” Repeated as bitter gallows humor in ex-EDF enclaves.

### 4.4 Tattoo Lexicon

- Broken ring around wrist: completed contract, exile intact.
- Three descending dots at clavicle: override episodes survived.
- Faded anchor and crossline: failed reintegration attempt.

**Continuity guardrail:** These artifacts should reflect coercion legacy without flattening veterans into one-note trauma symbols.

**Authority citations:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §8; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (A, I); `characters/supporting-cast-depth-atlas-v2.md`.

---

## 5) Conflict-Era Information Artifacts

### 5.1 Casualty Uncertainty Tagging (Public Feed)

Bulletins include tags like “count provisional,” “jurisdiction disputed,” “log mismatch pending.” This normalizes uncertainty rather than pretending omniscience.

### 5.2 Home Printer Warning Sticker

“Verify before amplify. Synthetic incident clips cost lives.” Attached to cheap node-printers in mixed-jurisdiction districts.

### 5.3 Neighborhood Verification Circle Ritual

Residents gather weekly to review major claims and designate what is “trusted enough to act on” versus “watch only.” This is governance from below.

### 5.4 Memorial Wall Practice

Names are added in pencil first, ink only after corroboration. The ritual reflects both grief and distrust of manipulated casualty reports.

**Authority citations:** `canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md` (CSTN); `series/media-and-propaganda-systems-pack-v1.md`; `ops/command-economy-legal-appendices-v2.md` (Appendix R).

---

## 6) Market and Labor Texture Artifacts

### 6.1 Technician Hiring Card (Belt Cooperative)

Lists certifications, previous dock references, and “traceability pledge” promising not to introduce unlogged critical components.

### 6.2 Emergency Ration Auction Sign

“Open bids suspended. Need-ranked distribution in effect.” Appears when cooperative governance overrides price mechanisms under shock.

### 6.3 Feedstock Barrel Markings

Color-coded marks indicate quality confidence and seizure risk. Traders whisper that certain marks are “legal poison,” meaning technically sellable but likely to trigger inspections.

### 6.4 Repair Shop Rulebook Note

“Never trust a perfect manifest.” Mechanics assume falsified paperwork and test every critical part regardless of documentation.

**Authority citations:** `tech/fabrication-systems.md`; `canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md` (SFAB, MARC-adjacent); `ops/logistics-replenishment-cadence-table-v1.md`.

---

## 7) Domestic and Relationship Micro-Textures

### 7.1 Family Budget Phrasebook

In many households, expenses are sorted into three colloquial categories:
- “Breath” (life-support essentials).
- “Tools” (income-enabling repairs, software, transit access).
- “Dream” (nonessential aspirations often deferred indefinitely).

### 7.2 Conflict Phrase Drift

Partners arguing under scarcity say “You spent from breath” rather than “you wasted money.” This embeds political economy into intimacy.

### 7.3 Child Game: Dock Court

Children roleplay arbitration hearings with toy warrants and fake stamps. Adults joke it is the most practical civics education available.

### 7.4 Apology Ritual in Mixed-Origin Households

A common phrase: “I spoke with Earth certainty.” Meaning: I talked as if my information was complete when it was delayed or partial.

**Authority citations:** `characters/relationship-matrix-v1.md`; `canon/ritual-language-and-military-slang-drift-v1.md`; `tech/interplanetary-transit-and-comms-envelope-v1.md`.

---

## 8) Coalition Governance Era Artifacts (Books 7–10)

### 8.1 Public Hearing Token Strip

Civilians attending major policy hearings receive numbered token strips with guaranteed response slots. Tokens are traded, gifted, or pooled by neighborhood councils.

### 8.2 Sunset Clock Display

Emergency powers are shown on public countdown boards at major transit hubs. Clock tampering becomes symbolic political violence.

### 8.3 Reconstruction Contract Boilerplate

Requires local labor participation floor and public cost ledger posting. Contractors complain; communities treat it as dignity baseline.

### 8.4 Amnesty Notice Footnote

“Acceptance does not erase harms; it limits state penalty under listed conditions.” A legal phrase that becomes common speech in reconciliation debates.

**Authority citations:** `series/coalition-governance-protocols-v1.md`; `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (F, I); `series/reconquest-institutional-integration-matrix-v1.md`.

## 9) Social Texture Injection Grid for Writers

When drafting a scene, include at least two artifact layers:
1. **Institutional residue:** signage, clause, policy snippet, or process token.
2. **Human adaptation:** slang, ritual, workaround, or household practice.

For high-stakes scenes, include a third layer:
3. **Trust signal:** who is believed, what records are trusted, and what remains uncertain.

Example: A docking confrontation can include a warrant code phrase, chalkboard symbol for dispute conditions, and a line ritual requiring mirrored logs before opening clamps.

**Authority citations:** `ops/style-guide.md`; `ops/dialogue-engine.md`; `ops/contradiction-scanner-checklist-v1.md`.

---

## 10) Continuity Safety Notes

- Avoid portraying Earth civilians as uniformly indoctrinated or Belt civilians as uniformly libertarian; both zones are mixed and adaptive.
- Maintain exile and veteran artifact diversity by class, origin, and injury profile.
- Ensure FVB risk appears in insurance language, dock rituals, and convoy planning assumptions.
- Keep legal jargon grounded with plain-language spillover into daily speech.
- Preserve the acquisition/databank split indirectly by ensuring rumor artifacts do not rewrite locked chronology.

**Authority citations:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §§9, 14; `canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md`; `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`.

## 12) Ritual and Holiday Drift Under Conflict

### 12.1 Silence Minute for Lost Signals
In many Belt communities, one minute of silence is observed not for confirmed dead but for those with unresolved telemetry loss beyond recovery windows.

### 12.2 Ledger Night
Neighborhood councils publicly read mutual-aid debts and forgiveness decisions. It is equal parts accounting, confession, and social repair.

### 12.3 Returnless Day
Exile corridor communities mark the date of contract release with empty place settings for Earth homes they cannot legally revisit.

### 12.4 Verification Vigil
After major disinformation shocks, people gather to compare source chains before sharing clips; candles are replaced by device screen lights in low-power zones.

**Authority citations:** `locations/belt-culture-zones-and-exile-corridors-v1.md`; `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §§8, 14; `series/media-and-propaganda-systems-pack-v1.md`.

---

## 13) Slang and Speech Register by Social Position

### 13.1 Administrative Middle Class (Earth)
Common phrases: “policy variance,” “non-actionable,” “pending confidence update,” “administratively resolved.”

### 13.2 Port Labor Crews
Common phrases: “show hash,” “cold paper,” “bad clamp day,” “queue burned.”

### 13.3 Ex-Marine Peer Groups
Common phrases: “red drift,” “quiet hand,” “five-year math,” “override weather.”

### 13.4 Coalition Civics Activists
Common phrases: “sunset or it’s theater,” “publish dissent,” “rights aren’t latency optional.”

Use register shifts to indicate trust and power distance inside dialogue scenes.

**Authority citations:** `canon/ritual-language-and-military-slang-drift-v1.md`; `ops/dialogue-quality-rubric.md`; `characters/relationship-matrix-v1.md`.

## 14) Food, Work, and Shelter Texture Tables

### 14.1 Typical Belt Shared Meal Patterns
- High-protein stews built around shelf-stable legumes and reclaimed algae products.
- “Power window baking” during low-demand energy intervals.
- Communal spice pools as informal status signal and generosity metric.

### 14.2 Shift-Change Customs
- Brief line checks as social trust ritual.
- Exchange of “problem forecasts” (what is likely to fail this cycle).
- Shared logbook signatures when disagreements occur, to avoid blame rewriting.

### 14.3 Shelter Hierarchies
- Core hull apartments near stable life-support nodes.
- Mid-ring modular units with intermittent service quality.
- Fringe compartments with high noise, variable pressure comfort, and frequent relay outages.

### 14.4 Domestic Repair Culture
“Patch now, certify later” exists but is socially bounded: tolerated for noncritical comforts, condemned for life-support pathways.

## 15) Social Faultlines and Bridge Practices

### 15.1 Faultline: Earth Credential Elites vs Belt Practical Specialists
Earth professionals often distrust uncertified Belt expertise; Belt communities distrust Earth-issued certification monopolies.

### 15.2 Faultline: Survivor Communities vs Reintegration Advocates
Victim groups fear impunity; reintegration advocates fear permanent underclass militarization.

### 15.3 Faultline: Safety Maximalists vs Liberty Maximalists
Debates over AI/fab governance reproduce old monopoly anxieties in new institutions.

### 15.4 Bridge Practice: Joint Audit Days
Mixed teams inspect facilities and publish plain-language findings, building trust through co-produced verification.

### 15.5 Bridge Practice: Shared Apprenticeship Exchanges
Youth from different jurisdictions rotate through docks, clinics, and archives to reduce stereotype inheritance.

## 16) Artifact-Driven Scene Starters

1. A mother rewrites a service appeal in plain language after a clerk rejects her “political tone,” then gets a result when she frames harm in algorithm-compatible terms.
2. Dock workers refuse transfer until mirror hash verification arrives, while armed security insists delay risks wider threat.
3. A Ledger Night turns into confrontation when one debtor is revealed to have profited from counterfeit med allotment codes.
4. A Returnless Day ceremony is interrupted by a recruitment pitch from a spoiler faction promising “real homecoming.”
5. A public sunset clock is vandalized; communities disagree whether it was authoritarian sabotage or anti-state protest.

These starters convert macro canon into social reality without exposition-heavy narration.
