# Stewards of Progress — Belt Culture Zones + Exile Corridors v1

Status: **SOFT-CANON regional culture atlas**  
Scope: Belt social ecologies, settlement governance norms, where exiles are absorbed or exploited  
Continuity anchor: `locations/strategic-theater-atlas-v1.md` + EDF exile policy in canon ledger

## 1) Belt Is Not a Frontier Blank

The Belt is a logistics civilization made of interdependent micro-societies. Cultural differences are driven by maintenance burden, cargo rhythms, and hazard profile—not by abstract ideology alone.

---

## 2) Primary Culture Zones

## 2.1 Contract-Core Habitats (CCH)

### Economic base
Long-cycle mining contracts, refinery processing, stable export quotas to Earth-linked buyers.

### Social features
- Formal shift discipline.
- Credit systems tied to equipment uptime.
- Governance by contract councils (elected in form, dominated by operations foremen in practice).

### Political stance
Public neutrality, private resentment of Earth pricing controls. Residents fear disruption more than domination, because a disrupted week can kill life-support budgets.

### Story pressure
Characters here may reject rebellion not out of loyalty, but because rebellion threatens oxygen procurement schedules.

---

## 2.2 Free Dock Meshes (FDM)

### Economic base
Transshipment, repair services, gray-market brokerage, documentation laundering.

### Social features
- High migrant churn.
- Reputation economies (“who paid, who vented a crew, who patched a hull at cost”).
- Multi-jurisdiction dispute boards, often backed by armed insurers.

### Political stance
Pragmatic anti-monopoly culture. They resist Earth control mainly when it disrupts trade fluidity.

### Story pressure
Alliances are transactional and expiring; betrayal is common but not random—it follows credit stress.

---

## 2.3 Deep Rock Lineages (DRL)

### Economic base
Family and kin-cluster claims on older extraction nodes.

### Social features
- Heritage maps for tunnels and void-risk zones.
- Child training starts early in safety procedures and tool literacy.
- Memory traditions encode disasters as practical lessons, not heroic myths.

### Political stance
Hostile to both Earth ministries and transient profiteers. Prioritize local continuity over ideology.

### Story pressure
These communities can become hard anchors for coalition legitimacy if respected, or durable insurgents if patronized.

---

## 2.4 Exile Sink Settlements (ESS)

### Economic base
Labor pooling, salvage economies, security-for-rations, micro-fab refurbishing.

### Social features
- Dense concentration of former EDF personnel.
- Elevated trauma rates and command-trust collapse.
- Informal justice systems weighted toward immediate harm prevention.

### Political stance
Highly volatile. Capable of disciplined defense when led well, but vulnerable to militia capture.

### Story pressure
Best place to show post-Earth identity reconstruction and the cost of militarized socialization.

## 3) Exile Corridors: How People Actually Arrive

Exile is not one event; it is a transport pipeline.

### 3.1 Corridor stages
1. **Term completion processing** at Earth-aligned naval platform.  
2. **AERS issuance** with legal release language.  
3. **Transit assignment** to outbound convoy (often under-provisioned).  
4. **Disembark selection** based on labor demand, faction influence, and quiet punishment priorities.  
5. **Status handoff failure:** records intentionally incomplete, causing identity and entitlement disputes on arrival.

### 3.2 Why records are degraded
- Limits veterans’ ability to prove Earth-side obligations.
- Increases dependency on local power brokers for housing and work.
- Prevents immediate formation of coherent political veteran blocs.

## 4) Ports of Consequence (Generic Templates)

## 4.1 Clean Port
High-governance docking node with strict inspection discipline.
- Good med triage.
- Low corruption.
- Expensive berths and restrictive residency criteria.

**Effect on exiles:** filters out high-risk arrivals, exporting instability elsewhere.

## 4.2 Open Port
Throughput-first docking node.
- Fast cargo movement.
- Negotiable paperwork.
- Security delegated to contractor cooperatives.

**Effect on exiles:** rapid absorption into labor market but high exploitation risk.

## 4.3 Dead Port
Decaying station sustained by salvage and intermittent aid.
- Unreliable atmosphere and shielding maintenance.
- Patchwork authority.
- High violence tied to scarce critical parts.

**Effect on exiles:** where discarded people are effectively warehoused.

---

## 5) Social Institutions Unique to Belt Cultures

### 5.1 Breath Commons
Community-managed reserve of scrubber material and emergency O2 stocks. Misuse is treated as near-sacramental betrayal.

### 5.2 Hull Courts
Fast arbitration for negligence causing pressure loss, contamination, or docking hazard. Sentences emphasize repair labor over imprisonment.

### 5.3 Debt Wake Registries
Public logs of unpaid obligations after death or disappearance. Families can clear names by completing repair/service equivalents.

### 5.4 Quiet Hours Doctrine
Non-essential comm chatter is restricted during high-risk maneuvers. Cultural respect for this rule doubles as a test of adulthood.

---

## 6) Culture Under Material Constraint

### 6.1 Art forms that survive
- Pressure-drum ensembles using recycled membrane composites.
- Low-light mural strips in service corridors.
- Oral serials broadcast during maintenance shifts.

### 6.2 Why these persist
They require low mass, low energy, and can be paused for emergencies. Belt art survives because it coexists with survival work.

---

## 7) Earth Influence Vectors in the Belt

Earth control travels through four channels:
1. Class 2 medical/compute dependencies.  
2. Insurance underwriting for major cargo runs.  
3. Legal recognition of claim ownership.  
4. Access to certified fusion-drive superconductive components.

Belt autonomy expands when any one vector can be substituted locally.

---

## 8) Failure Patterns (Useful for Plot)

### Pattern A: Oxygen blackmail
A faction seizes scrubber supply chains to force political compliance.

### Pattern B: Document erasure warfare
Records tampering turns citizens into legal non-persons.

### Pattern C: Dock scheduling sabotage
Minor timing disruptions cascade into missed convoy windows and district ration shocks.

### Pattern D: Veteran militia capture
Exile settlements are recruited by charismatic commanders offering structure in exchange for obedience.

Each failure pattern should have a maintenance-root cause, not pure villain intent.

---

## 9) Earth-Belt Moral Asymmetry

Earth officials often frame Belt violence as cultural deficiency. Belt populations frame Earth governance as violence outsourced through paperwork and scarcity controls. Both perspectives contain partial truths; the series should force characters to confront both.

---

## 10) Location Writing Rules

1. Every habitat description must include: gravity profile, atmosphere risk posture, repair doctrine, and dispute mechanism.  
2. Avoid “lawless Belt” shorthand; specify which law exists, who enforces it, and what resource funds enforcement.  
3. Exile arrivals should produce measurable local effects (rent pressure, med demand, ammunition flow, labor competition).  
4. Tie cultural behavior to engineering constraints whenever possible.

---

## 11) Open Build Tasks

- Name 8–12 recurring stations across the four culture zones.
- Define one flagship annual inter-habitat festival with safety-compatible format.
- Model how second-generation exile children alter ESS governance norms.
