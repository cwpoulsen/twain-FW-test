# Stewards of Progress — Strategic Theater Atlas v2

Status: **Operational geography baseline (SOFT, canon-constrained)**  
Purpose: define where governance has teeth, where it frays, and what each region does to campaign tempo.

## 1) Earth Core Zone (ECZ)

### Control Texture
- Dense civic mesh, highest Consensus model confidence, shortest policy-to-enforcement loop.
- Class-2 queue authority and legal harmonization functions concentrated here.
- Media cadence optimized for “stability first,” with rapid narrative preemption.

### Story Pressure
- Direct action is rare and costly; influence arrives as paperwork, denied access, and sanitized command traffic.

---

## 2) Cislunar Logistics Ring (CLR)

### Control Texture
- Throughput choke between launch dependency and deep-space fusion logistics.
- Inspection lawfare, cargo provenance fights, and berth-priority manipulation are routine weapons.
- Minor schedule slips propagate into Belt shortages within one to two convoy cycles.

### Story Pressure
- Best region for procedural combat: custody disputes, forged manifests, and loyalty tests disguised as compliance checks.

---

## 3) Inner-System Transit Corridors

### Control Texture
- Heavily watched lanes with imperfect coverage at relay transition boundaries.
- Convoy doctrine favors predictable cadence, enabling ambush windows for prepared adversaries.
- FVB actors exploit maintenance windows, spoofed IDs, and escort fatigue patterns.

### Story Pressure
- Campaign outcomes often hinge on burn timing, sensor deception, and willingness to spend propellant now for survivability later.

---

## 4) Belt Industrial Arc (BIA)

### Control Texture
- Distributed extraction/refinement habitats under mixed legal regimes and uneven infrastructure maturity.
- Politics are maintenance-driven: air, heat, hull, and medstock uptime outrank ideology in daily legitimacy.
- Earth leverage operates through queue pressure, sanctions, and narrative framing rather than continuous direct command.

### Story Pressure
- Coalition building is inseparable from repair labor, convoy protection, and evidence credibility.

---

## 5) Peripheral Habitat Zones (PHZ)

### Control Texture
- Thin-margin settlements with brittle redundancy and high improvisation requirements.
- Fast institutional experimentation; also high vulnerability to predatory rackets.
- Reintegration policy success/failure is immediately visible in casualty and retention rates.

### Story Pressure
- Moral ambiguity is concrete: protect autonomy, or impose order before systems collapse.

---

## 6) Black Logistics Routes (BLR)

### Control Texture
- Unofficial routes built from trust brokers, sensor blind spots, forged transponder ladders, and relay asymmetries.
- Used by resistance, smugglers, and FVB operators alike; intent depends on custody and destination, not route alone.

### Story Pressure
- Enables “impossible” movement at compounding risk: every successful run increases counter-surveillance adaptation.

## 7) Theater Principles (Locked)
1. **Distance converts command into bargaining.**
2. **Throughput chokepoints are political artillery.**
3. **Life-support reliability beats slogan legitimacy.**
4. **FVB disruption is ecological, not episodic; anti-piracy must hit recruitment funnels, not only hulls.**
5. **No zone grants omniscience: every actor operates on stale, partial, or manipulated telemetry.
