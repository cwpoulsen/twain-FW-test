# Stewards of Progress — Strategic Theater Atlas v1

Status: **Operational geography baseline**  
Purpose: define where power works, where it fails, and why.

---

## 1) Earth Core Zone (ECZ)

### Description
Planetary governance center with dense link infrastructure, highest Consensus fidelity, and concentrated Steward administration.

### Functional characteristics
- Fastest policy-to-compliance loop in setting.
- Highest concentration of Class 2 fabrication governance and distribution controls.
- Strong narrative-conditioning saturation in public information environments.

### Story use
- Earth is mostly seen through memory, command traffic, propaganda artifacts, and consequence chains.

---

## 2) Cislunar Logistics Ring (CLR)

### Description
Orbital transfer and staging architecture connecting planetary launch systems to deep-space routes.

### Functional characteristics
- Primary chokepoint between chemical launch dependence and fusion-drive freedom.
- High military scrutiny due to strategic throughput importance.
- Frequent congestion risk; schedule disruption can cascade to Belt shortages.

### Story use
- Ideal setting for contested inspections, covert cargo swaps, and loyalty tests inside procedural environments.

---

## 3) Inner System Transit Corridors

### Description
High-traffic lanes linking Earth-controlled logistics hubs to outbound industrial routes.

### Functional characteristics
- Tracking is robust but not total; spoofing opportunities exist near relay transition windows.
- Convoy defense doctrine favors predictability, creating exploitable rhythm patterns.

### Story use
- Cat-and-mouse engagements where timing math matters more than raw firepower.

---

## 4) Belt Industrial Arc (BIA)

### Description
Distributed extraction-refinement-habitation region containing diverse political forms and uneven infrastructure reliability.

### Functional characteristics
- Multi-million residents under mixed legal regimes.
- Life support and fabrication uptime dominate political bargaining.
- Consensus influence fragmented by latency, outage, and local mediation layers.

### Story use
- Primary theater for coalition politics, survival economics, and factional recombination.

---

## 5) Peripheral Habitats (PHZ)

### Description
Smaller, high-risk settlements at system edges with weaker security, thin margins, and adaptive governance norms.

### Functional characteristics
- Rapid institutional innovation out of necessity.
- Higher susceptibility to predatory actors.
- Greater narrative diversity and less ideological synchronization.

### Story use
- Good arenas for moral ambiguity: protect autonomy or impose order to prevent collapse.

---

## 6) Black Logistics Routes (BLR)

### Description
Unofficial transport paths using maintenance windows, sensor blind spots, forged transponder identities, and relay asymmetries.

### Functional characteristics
- Support resistance logistics and criminal trafficking simultaneously.
- Reliability depends on trust brokers and technical specialists.

### Story use
- Recurring mechanism for impossible movement at steep risk/cost.

## 7) Strategic Geography Principles (Locked)

1. Power density declines with distance from Earth core control mesh.  
2. Material dependence does not equal ideological obedience.  
3. Every stable habitat runs on maintenance competence, not slogans.  
4. Transit chokepoints are political weapons.  
5. Any faction that jeopardizes life support for symbolism loses local legitimacy quickly.
