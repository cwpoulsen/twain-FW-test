# Stewards of Progress — Books 5–7 Bridge Operational Sequence Map v1

Status: Timeline support map for 20 scene packets in Books 5–7 bridge.
Authority refs:
- `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md` (seq 0300 campaign umbrella)

Note: Sequence IDs below are bridge-local children of master seq 0300 and are designed for packet ordering + continuity checks.

| bridge_seq | approx_world_window_utc | packet_id | event_focus | dependency_gate | reality_gate_pressure |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0310 | 2059-02 to 2059-03 | B5-S01 | Charter oxygen allocation vote survives razor margin | B5 handoff #1 | Oxygen burn-rate math + delayed vote certification across nodes |
| 0315 | 2059-03 | B5-S02 | FVB recruitment funnel disruption doctrine test | anti-FVB doctrine lock | Dock-tube low-g restraint protocol; no free-fire recoil drift |
| 0320 | 2059-04 | B5-S03 | Class-2 queue riot + anti-capture audit response | Branch C prevention | Queue control limited by coolant + med-stock depletion clocks |
| 0325 | 2059-05 | B5-S04 | Reintegration under justice pressure | B5 handoff #3 support | Identity checks delayed by relay lag; custody fatigue on escort staff |
| 0330 | 2059-06 | B5-S05 | Insurance market restart under piracy pressure | B7 corridor-law precursor | Premium calculations include real convoy delay and attrition risk |
| 0335 | 2059-07 | B5-S06 | Tribunal continuity under intimidation | legitimacy continuity | Hearing cadence constrained by adjudicator sleep-cycle degradation |
| 0340 | 2059-08 to 2059-09 | B5-S07 | Stress winter survival + sunset reserve command | closes B5 handoff set | Reserve drawdown + ration dilution; no emergency-stock magic refill |
| 0350 | 2060-01 | B6-S01 | Coolant parliament plural allocation | B6 condition #1 (start) | Coolant tonnage tradeoffs force civilian-first military tempo cuts |
| 0355 | 2060-02 | B6-S02 | Standards war and anti-lockout defense | Branch C mitigation | Field retrofits increase accident risk in mixed/low-g service spines |
| 0360 | 2060-03 | B6-S03 | Procurement sabotage sting | B6 condition #1 support | Multi-node sting branches preplanned; no real-time command retasking |
| 0365 | 2060-04 | B6-S04 | Labor fatigue revolt settlement | B6 condition #3 support | Sleep-cap enforcement and shift-rotation debt as explicit throughput limit |
| 0370 | 2060-05 | B6-S05 | Emergency sunset audit under active threat | B6 condition #2 satisfy | Audit evidence ages in transit; decisions taken with stale telemetry |
| 0375 | 2060-06 | B6-S06 | Spare-parts triage legitimacy test | B6 condition #3 support | Finite spares + repair queue prioritization constrain combat readiness |
| 0380 | 2060-07 | B6-S07 | Parity proof with anti-capture safeguards | closes B6 handoff set | Demonstration window bounded by heat load and maintenance debt |
| 0390 | 2061-01 | B7-S01 | Civilian convoy defense under constrained ROE | B7 condition #2 support | Escort recoil/attitude-control discipline in low-g transfer intercepts |
| 0395 | 2061-02 | B7-S02 | Inspection pipeline launch + backlog shock | B7 condition #1 (start) | Inspection latency creates legal queue spillover and berth-hour losses |
| 0400 | 2061-03 | B7-S03 | False-positive strike abort preserves legitimacy | anti-collapse lock | Sensor-confidence threshold + delayed corroboration prevents snap strike |
| 0405 | 2061-04 | B7-S04 | First sanctions ruling during intimidation | B7 condition #1 mature | Possession holds include fuel/coolant burn and crew-rest burden |
| 0410 | 2061-05 | B7-S05 | Live-capture anti-terror raid for funnel intel | anti-FVB doctrine maturity | Boarding tempo constrained by casualty carry and medevac slot scarcity |
| 0415 | 2061-06 | B7-S06 | Corridor-law threshold and Book 8 handoff decision | closes B7 handoff set | Handoff delayed until appeal backlog + escort fatigue indices clear floor |

## Continuity Check Notes
- No entries violate master timeline umbrella seq 0300.
- Packet order preserves cumulative character-state deltas (no reset of Lin/Isaac split-reconcile or Valerie restraint arc).
- Bridge sequence ensures Book 5 -> Book 6 -> Book 7 handoff criteria are testable and auditable.
