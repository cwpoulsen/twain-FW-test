## Continuity Check Notes
- No entries violate master timeline umbrella seq 0300.
- Packet order preserves cumulative character-state deltas (no reset of Lin/Isaac split-reconcile or Valerie restraint arc).
- Bridge sequence ensures Book 5 -> Book 6 -> Book 7 handoff criteria are testable and auditable.
