## Voice & Authority Lock (Wave 10)
- Use canonical actor names only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.
- Write in consequence-first cadence: mechanism -> decision -> cost.
- Preserve hard constraints: no miracle throughput, no real-time Earth command outside latency limits, no zero-cost victories.

## Arc Blocks

| Book | Approx sequence window | Strategic phase | Primary arc function | Dominant campaign cost |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0160–0200 | Betrayal + survival ignition | Escape and AI-seed custody inversion | Unit trust collapse + pursuit exposure |
| 2 | 0210–0230 | Alliance/provenance war | Determine who can authenticate truth-chain around seed system | Diplomatic friction + retaliation raids |
| 3 | 0240–0260 | Counterintelligence fracture | Regime purge cycle vs distributed verification networks | Civilian reliability stress + message chaos |
| 4 | 0270–0290 | Transition crisis | First durable governance cracks and vacuum conflicts | Security fragmentation + legal overload |
| 5 | 0300-range | Belt consolidation | Asterion League legitimacy hardening under scarcity pressure | Coalition discipline strain |
| 6 | 0320-range | Industrial parity race | Class path contest (Class3/4 base + Blackfly Class2 + Asterion Class1) | Queue war, sabotage tempo, FVB escalation reveal |
| 7 | 0340-range | Chokepoint campaigns | Inner-system lane control (Mars-Earth-Ceres and feeder routes) | Attrition, convoy losses, anti-piracy legitimacy tests |
| 8 | 0360-range | Earth approach operations | Political + military staging for reconquest entry | Resource depletion + coalition fracture risk |
| 9 | 0380-range | Earth reconquest | Multi-theater seizure plus succession/legitimacy conflict | Urban governance shock + compliance uncertainty |
| 10 | 0400-range | Settlement struggle | Anti-relapse architecture and post-war institutional design | Reintegration burden + predation suppression balance |

## Long-Arc Continuity Rules (Locked)
1. Reconquest is cumulative campaign pressure, not single-battle resolution.
2. Class 1 breakthrough expands options but does not repeal logistics, maintenance, or transit limits.
3. AI-seed arc remains custody/provenance governance conflict, not superweapon shortcut.
4. Post-victory governance fragility must remain visible through Books 9–10.
5. Unknown-position pursuit remains probabilistic dragnet behavior; no omniscient tracker logic.

## Freed Voider Bands Thread (Integrated)
- **Books 3–4:** recurrent convoy harassment and deniable rackets intensify at lane margins.
- **Books 5–6:** structural reveal—release/exile patterns were exploited to sustain outer-system instability.
- **Books 7–9:** anti-FVB doctrine becomes coalition legitimacy test (suppression-only vs reintegration-plus-enforcement).
- **Book 10:** long-term settlement viability depends on stable reintegration pathways and anti-predation institutions.

## Contradiction Triggers to Watch
- Any arc beat that grants instant Earth political collapse.
- Any timeline beat that skips Class2/queue constraints during sustained campaigning.
- Any anti-piracy victory that lacks recruitment-funnel and custody follow-through.
- Any “truth wins” beat without chain-of-custody survivability.
