## Long-Arc Continuity Rules

1. Reconquest is gradual; no single battle ends systemic control.
2. Class 1 breakthrough changes strategic options, not physics/logistics constraints.
3. AI-seed storyline remains a custody/governance problem, not instant superweapon conversion.
4. Post-victory books must show governance fragility and relapse risk.
