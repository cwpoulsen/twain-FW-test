# Stewards of Progress — Books 1–10 Arc Dependency Grid (Timeline Sequence) v1

Status: **Chronology-linked dependency matrix**  
Purpose: sequence-facing handoff logic and recovery routing for Books 1–10.

## Sequence Dependency Matrix

| Book | Sequence Window | Entry Preconditions | Exit Deliverables | Failure Branch Node | Recovery Node |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0160–0200 | Disposal doctrine active; Blackfly escaped but hunted; box mission live. | AI seed custody chain, first proof shards, sanctuary contacts. | FB-A1: evidence loss / custody break | R-A1: rebuild proof via witness + residual telemetry (slow path) |
| 2 | 0210–0230 | B1 custody survives; coalition contacts nonzero. | Witness pipelines, alliance-market protocols, strategic/personal sacrifice lock. | FB-A2: authenticity collapse | R-A2: third-party custody architecture + phased verify tools |
| 3 | 0240–0260 | B2 provenance survives enough to contest narrative. | Denial-resistant atrocity proof, relay/governor legitimacy fractures, transition pressure. | FB-B1: hardliner narrative recapture | R-B1: synchronized custody + legal-neutral publication stack |
| 4 | 0270–0290 | B3 proof causes structural split; vacuum risk acknowledged. | Interim charter, anti-relapse controls, conditional handover framework. | FB-B2: successor-tyranny consolidation | R-B2: sunset/audit rollback invocation + coalition strike leverage |
| 5 | 0300-range | B4 institutions exist but are brittle. | Belt consolidation baseline; anti-FVB doctrine v1; allocation legitimacy metrics. | FB-C1: peripheral collapse + pirate capture | R-C1: corridor triage + distributed civil-defense compacts |
| 6 | 0320-range | B5 governance survives first stress cycle. | Industrial parity controls, anti-capture fabrication governance, civilian stability uptick. | FB-C2: technocratic capture of throughput | R-C2: forced key rotation + open audit sanctions |
| 7 | 0340-range | B6 parity usable for security operations. | Inner-lane corridor law; attrition reduced without mass legitimacy loss. | FB-D1: convoy terror spiral | R-D1: life-support-first escort doctrine + adjudication fast lanes |
| 8 | 0360-range | B7 corridor framework holds minimally. | Earth approach staging: logistics, civil partners, coalition ROE alignment. | FB-D2: approach framed as occupation before landing | R-D2: political pre-commitments + visible civilian oversight cells |
| 9 | 0380-range | B8 staging viable and politically anchored. | Earth systems seizure with continuity-of-life-support preserved; recapture kernels constrained. | FB-D3: military win / governance loss | R-D3: reparations-first stabilization + service continuity surge |
| 10 | 0400-range | B9 control achieved but fragile. | Anti-relapse constitutional architecture, treaty enforcement mechanics, emergency power decommissioning. | FB-E1: relapse into renamed central coercion | R-E1: auto-sunset + treaty-trigger sanctions + ombuds escalation |

## Dependency Handoff Rules (Book-to-Book)

1. **B1 -> B2:** if AI seed custody breaks, B2 becomes retrieval/survival arc and delays alliance build by one phase.
2. **B2 -> B3:** if witness/provenance chain is weak, B3 must front-load authenticity infrastructure before major confrontations.
3. **B3 -> B4:** if denial remains viable in major jurisdictions, B4 charter legitimacy starts near zero and requires external guarantors.
4. **B4 -> B5:** if interim governance lacks enforceable sunsets, B5 opens in constitutional crisis, not consolidation.
5. **B5 -> B6:** if anti-FVB framework fails, B6 industrial throughput is continuously extorted and parity cannot stabilize civilians.
6. **B6 -> B7:** if fabrication oversight is captured, B7 corridor operations are read as empire rebuild, collapsing support.
7. **B7 -> B8:** if corridor law lacks appeals/transparency, Earth approach is politically dead-on-arrival.
8. **B8 -> B9:** if civil partner verification is incomplete, reconquest becomes occupation and insurgency seedbed.
9. **B9 -> B10:** if service continuity falls below survival threshold, B10 starts with humanitarian emergency overriding constitutional agenda.

## Mission/Scene Cross-Link Routing

- Operational exemplars (Books 1–4): `ops/books1-4-mission-scenario-bank-v1.md`
- Packet exemplars (Books 1–4): `series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md`
- Sequence-to-mission bridge: `timeline/books1-4-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`

For Books 5–10, attach each new mission packet to this file with:
- sequence index window,
- lane geometry + burn class,
- comm lag envelope,
- exit deliverable and next-book precondition.

## Contradiction Check (Timeline Pass)

- Sequence windows must remain monotonic with `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`.
- No handoff may assume instantaneous interplanetary reallocation.
- Recovery nodes cannot erase prior moral/strategic costs; they may only redirect trajectory.
- Any new Book 5–10 mission that changes entry/exit deliverables must update both:
  - `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`
  - `timeline/books1-10-strategic-reconquest-map-v1.md`
