## Sequence Blocks (Books 1–4)

> Index policy: use **1200-series** local block IDs to avoid collision with master timeline global sequence indices.

## Mapping Rules
1. Books 1–4 entries must remain compatible with 10-book expansion plan.
2. No mission may imply instantaneous transit or comm certainty (use transit/comms envelope).
3. AI-seed custody chain and Class 2/Class 1 fabrication politics must remain active pressure lines, not one-off reveals.
4. Inter-book redeployment beats must cite lane + burn class from `tech/fusion-transit-assumptions-and-lane-calculus-v1.md`.
5. Reality Gate checks are mandatory before promoting mission seeds to scene packets (`ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md`).

- `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books1-4-wave10-v1.md`

| sequence_index | packet cluster | mission seed span | consequence bridge focus |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1200 | B1-S01..B1-S06 | B1-01,02,04,05,08,10 | Betrayal/custody setup: obedience fracture, AI-seed burden, staged proof doctrine. |
| 1210 | B2-S01 | B2-01 | Entry into alliance-market legitimacy under logistics coercion. |
| 1220 | B2-S02..B2-S04 | B2-04,05,06 | Witness integrity, insider ambiguity, anti-panic control ethics. |
| 1230 | B2-S05..B2-S06 | B2-09,10 | Governor telemetry intake + source-vs-system climax cost. |
| 1240 | B3-S01..B3-S02 | B3-01,02 | Archive admissibility and deepfake refutation races. |
| 1250 | B3-S03 | B3-05 | Mutiny containment and module forensics under no-reinforcement reality. |
| 1260 | B3-S04..B3-S06 | B3-07,09,10 | Relay rekey governance, preemption legitimacy debt, synchronized proof release. |
| 1270 | B4-S01..B4-S02 | B4-01,02 | Transitional charter legitimacy under famine/lift chokepoint pressures. |
| 1280 | B4-S03..B4-S04 | B4-03,04 | Class-2 oversight trial and governor-stack retirement mechanics. |

## Transit-Gated Continuity Hooks (Books 1–4)

| Hook ID | Required lane reality | Plot consequence if ignored |
|---|---|---|
| TG-1200 | Earth->Ceres movement under BC-B is ~77–159 d (geometry dependent). | Early Book 2 cannot begin immediately after late Book 1 without a stated time jump/logistics bridge. |
| TG-1210 | Mars->Ceres reinforcement under BC-B is ~56–180 d. | “Surprise” Mars fleets in single-chapter timing are invalid. |
| TG-1220 | Belt intra-lane responses are usually 10–54 d (BC-B), faster only under BC-C at cost. | Coalition trust and resupply cadence must break/falter under long lane delays. |
| TG-1230 | Ceres->Jovian probes are 95–250 d (BC-B), 50–124 d (BC-C). | Jovian evidence threads must be planned seasons ahead, not tactical next-day pivots. |

## Wave 14 Systemic Carryover Overlay (Books 1–4)

| sequence_index | delayed-systemic propagation | legitimacy aftershock | logistics debt propagation | relationship stress carryover |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1200 | Disposal telemetry becomes systemwide audit catalyst. | "Hesitation" stigma seeded in official channels. | BC-C heat debt and key-split courier burden begin. | Hale/Valerie align; Marko distrust increases. |
| 1210–1220 | Consent-first witness doctrine formalizes evidence culture. | Broker diplomacy read as complicity by victims. | Escort diversion starts med-convoy deficit. | Lin/Hale pacing conflict becomes persistent. |
| 1230 | Source-vs-system decision institutionalized as recurring command dilemma. | Amnesty corridor politically weaponized. | Abandoned-objective windows cause two-cycle recovery lag. | Valerie betrayal debt carried into Book 3. |
| 1240–1260 | Authenticity war and relay governance become standing campaigns, not episodic events. | PAC neutrality contested; preemption stain persists post-crisis. | Stealth route burn + elite asset depletion reduce strategic flexibility. | Team cohesion depends on explicit accountability rituals. |
| 1270–1290 | Charter + oversight architecture replaces monopoly but remains fragile and debt-heavy. | Relief failures and tribunal backlog drive anti-process backlash. | Security concentration, audits, and firmware rollouts slow recovery into Book 5. | Leadership role inversion stabilizes governance while increasing emotional exhaustion. |
