# Stewards of Progress — Master Timeline Sequence v1

Status: **Chronology authority draft (hard-sf enforcement)**  
Rule binding: all future events must carry world datetime + sequence index and reconcile with this ledger.

## Chronology Integrity Notes

- Sequence indices are immutable IDs once referenced by scene files.
- If any event date changes, impacted travel/comms windows must be recalculated and logged.
- Character files should reference sequence indices for formative events to prevent drift.
- Book 1 sequence lock: 0170 (betrayal/escape) must precede 0180 (databank moral pivot); do not invert without explicit retcon.
- Faction/tech references used in timeline scenes should align with coherence-pass nomenclature in `factions/major-factions.md` and `tech/fabricator-classes.md` (Class 4→1 ladder).
