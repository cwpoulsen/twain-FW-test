# Stewards of Progress — Master Timeline Sequence v1

Status: **Chronology authority draft (Wave 3 / curveball integrated)**  
Rule: all future events require world datetime + sequence index and must reconcile with this ledger.

## Chronology Integrity Notes
- Sequence indices are immutable IDs once referenced.
- If dates change, recompute travel/comms windows (`tech/fusion-transit-assumptions-and-lane-calculus-v1.md`).
- Book 1 lock remains: 0170 precedes 0180.
- 0180 now includes AI-seed custody implications.
- Long-arc planning now uses a 10-book horizon.
