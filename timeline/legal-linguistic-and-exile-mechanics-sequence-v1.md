# Stewards of Progress — Legal/Linguistic/Exile Mechanics Sequence v1

Status: **SOFT timeline augmentation**  
Rule: attach social-system changes to dates so culture shifts remain causal, not atmospheric.

## Integration Notes

- This file extends `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md` without replacing existing indices.
- Prefer index references in scene docs (e.g., “post-0115 AERS processing norms”) to prevent social-system continuity drift.
- If 0115 is revised, update marine backstory legal statuses and Belt settlement demographic pressures accordingly.

## Causality Summary

1. Permit and court proceduralization made coercion legible as administration, not repression.  
2. Media consolidation synchronized vocabulary, which simplified legal compliance messaging.  
3. Exile formalization exported politically risky veterans out of Earth civic space.  
4. Veteran concentration in ESS zones altered Belt speech, security, and legitimacy structures.  
5. Belt witness-chain media evolved as a direct adaptation to Earth narrative speed advantage.
