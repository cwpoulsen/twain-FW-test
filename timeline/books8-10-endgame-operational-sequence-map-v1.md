## Continuity Check Notes
- No entries require real-time omniscient command across latency-separated theaters.
- Sequence preserves cumulative character-state deltas from Books 5–7 into Books 8–10 (no reset drift).
- Branch D risks are repeatedly mitigated through life-support-first constraints, not rhetorical claims.
- Terminal state remains imperfect, auditable, and contestable per Book 10 dependency requirement.
