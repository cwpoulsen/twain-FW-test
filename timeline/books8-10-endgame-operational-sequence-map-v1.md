# Stewards of Progress — Books 8–10 Endgame Operational Sequence Map v1

Status: Timeline support map for 24 scene packets in Books 8–10 endgame bridge.

Authority refs:
- `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md` (seq 0400+ late-war umbrella continuity)

Note: Sequence IDs below continue bridge-local ordering from Books 5–7 map and are used for packet ordering + dependency audit checks.

|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0420 | 2061-08 | B8-S01 | Cross-coalition ROE compact ratified with civilian veto triggers | B8 condition #3 foundation | ROE adoption lag across nodes; stale acknowledgments tolerated by design |
| 0425 | 2061-08 to 2061-09 | B8-S02 | Earth labor partner verification by open referendum | B8 condition #1 partial | Ballot integrity depends on delayed ledger reconciliation, not instant tally |
| 0430 | 2061-09 | B8-S03 | Decoy-strike restraint under uncertain sensor returns | anti-collapse legitimacy lock | Sensor confidence floor + low-g intercept uncertainty block snap escalation |
| 0435 | 2061-09 | B8-S04 | POW exchange with layered anti-infiltration controls | postwar governability precondition | Transfer choreography constrained by berth windows and guard fatigue |
| 0440 | 2061-10 | B8-S05 | Coolant depot failure forces tempo reset | B8 condition #2 realism test | Replacement loads 27–41 day transit; combat tempo reduced to life-support baseline |
| 0445 | 2061-10 | B8-S06 | Verified evidence campaign defeats invasion disinfo | anti-monopoly legitimacy preservation | Evidence release cadence paced to relay lag and chain-of-custody verification |
| 0450 | 2061-11 | B8-S07 | Casualty throughput drill lowers offensive envelope | Branch D prevention | Medevac capacity + triage staffing cap assault windows |
| 0455 | 2061-11 | B8-S08 | Launch threshold vote delays seizure cycle one turn | closes B8 handoff set | Delay accepted to clear maintenance backlog and crew-rest minimums |
| 0460 | 2062-01 | B9-S01 | Kernel ring compartment breach with life-support continuity | B9 condition #1 progress | Breach response in mixed-g shafts requires tether discipline and slower clears |
| 0465 | 2062-01 | B9-S02 | Countervalue blackmail mitigated via evacuation-priority pivot | governability floor protection | Evac priorities shaped by finite tug lift and shelter oxygen buffers |
| 0470 | 2062-02 | B9-S03 | Municipal service council restored under fire | B9 condition #2 support | Service restoration phased by spare-part latency and exhausted crews |
| 0475 | 2062-02 | B9-S04 | Asterion support accepted with anti-immunity safeguards | anti-capture continuity lock | Aid surge bounded by fab throughput + inspection lag |
| 0480 | 2062-03 | B9-S05 | Valerie brother escrow confrontation resolved law-first | B9 character lock satisfied | Capture pathway chosen over kill due tribunal evidence and comm delay constraints |
| 0485 | 2062-03 | B9-S06 | Twelve-grid survival operation contains collapse cascade | B9 condition #2 reinforcement | Grid survival bounded by coolant, membrane, and technician fatigue limits |
| 0490 | 2062-04 | B9-S07 | War-to-law timeline announced before campaign end | B9 condition #3 credibility gate | Announcement triggers additional sabotage while legal rollout lags by lane |
| 0495 | 2062-04 to 2062-05 | B9-S08 | Kernel escrow completion with ceasefire corridor compromise | closes B9 handoff set | Ceasefire corridors paced by real transit and escort refit cycles |
| 0500 | 2062-07 | B10-S01 | Emergency command key surrender begins | B10 authority drawdown lock | Slower threat response accepted as constitutional tradeoff |
| 0505 | 2062-07 | B10-S02 | Tribunal overflow triage without due-process collapse | anti-revenge capture lock | Case throughput constrained by clerk fatigue and courier-delay evidence service |
| 0510 | 2062-08 | B10-S03 | FVB reintegration corridor pilot launched | dual-track legitimacy condition | Monitoring burden limited by officer staffing and relay blackout intervals |
| 0515 | 2062-08 | B10-S04 | Cognitive-rights exception narrowed with sunset triggers | bounded coercion requirement | Sunset enforcement tied to delayed audit packets, not central instant override |
| 0520 | 2062-09 | B10-S05 | Treaty-trigger sanctions applied to allied power grab | treaty enforceability proof | Sanction execution consumes spare inspection hulls and fuel margin |
| 0525 | 2062-09 | B10-S06 | Ombuds net maintained under comms sabotage | self-correction infrastructure lock | Appeals rerouted through pod couriers with 3–9 day legal latency |
| 0530 | 2062-10 | B10-S07 | Founder authority extension vote fails | founder step-back closure | Security posture degradation acknowledged under post-vote fatigue conditions |
| 0535 | 2062-10 to 2062-11 | B10-S08 | Imperfect peace stress test contains multi-shock crisis | terminal condition achieved | Crisis containment succeeds only with triage + attrition acceptance, not surge omnipotence |

## Continuity Check Notes
- No entries require real-time omniscient command across latency-separated theaters.
- Sequence preserves cumulative character-state deltas from Books 5–7 into Books 8–10 (no reset drift).
- Branch D risks are repeatedly mitigated through life-support-first constraints, not rhetorical claims.
- Terminal state remains imperfect, auditable, and contestable per Book 10 dependency requirement.

## Wave 14 Systemic Carryover Overlay (Books 8–10)

| bridge_seq band | delayed-systemic propagation | legitimacy aftershock | logistics debt propagation | relationship stress carryover |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0420–0455 | ROE restraint + medevac realism lock anti-relapse behavior before seizure phase. | Missed opportunities become persistent hawk critique. | Depot failure and maintenance debt narrow Book 9 tempo envelope. | Command disagreements stay functional but emotionally unresolved. |
| 0460–0495 | War-to-law practices activated before total victory, enabling governable transition. | Mercy/slow-war optics split coalition legitimacy blocs. | Evacuation-first and escrow logistics prolong campaign and consume reserve escorts. | Protection-over-punishment shift strains identity of former combat leaders. |
| 0500–0535 | Constitutional drawdown + correction networks establish imperfect self-correcting peace. | Founder exit causes temporary confidence dip and elite backlash campaigns. | Judicial/oversight workloads and transit latency remain chronic constraints. | Founders maintain private solidarity while public authority intentionally fragments. |
