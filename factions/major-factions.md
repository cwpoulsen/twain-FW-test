---

## 1) Concord of Iron Spans (CIS)
**Type:** Federal-industrial republic alliance  
**Core Incentive:** Preserve free interstellar trade lanes and template commons governance.

**Strategic culture**
- Believes distributed manufacturing is a civil right and strategic hedge.
- Prefers coalition legitimacy over unilateral speed.

**Fabrication posture**
- Dense Class-I and Class-II network.
- Moderate Class-III capability; relies on allies for orbital surge.
- Strong validation doctrine, slower emergency output.

**Command structure**
- Civilian Oversight Senate -> War Throughput Directorate -> Theater Marshals.
- DAL release keys require mixed civilian-military quorum.

**Operational strengths**
- High reliability over long campaigns.
- Strong coalition interoperability and legal template sharing.

**Operational weaknesses**
- Consensus delays in fast-moving crises.
- Vulnerable to political deadlock when casualties spike.

## 2) Directorate of Helion Extraction (DHE)
**Type:** Resource-authoritarian technocracy  
**Core Incentive:** Secure monopoly over rare-earth and isotope corridors.

**Strategic culture**
- Throughput is treated as national destiny.
- Accepts civilian austerity as permanent wartime condition.

**Fabrication posture**
- Heavy Class-II concentration near extraction belts.
- Rapidly growing Class-III military seedyards.
- Experimental quasi-autonomous Class-IV fragments under secret programs.

**Command structure**
- Supreme Extraction Council -> Production Security Bureau -> Sector Procurators.
- CRK authority concentrated in intelligence-cleared industrial elite.

**Operational strengths**
- Fast surge capacity.
- Can absorb huge materiel losses short-term.

**Operational weaknesses**
- High validation debt during offensives.
- Internal purges degrade mid-tier expertise.
- Overcentralized DAL is single-point strategic risk.

## 3) Vesper League of Contract Worlds (VLCW)
**Type:** Corporate charter confederation  
**Core Incentive:** Preserve contract enforcement and profit continuity under war stress.

**Strategic culture**
- Treats war as a managed market disruption.
- Prioritizes insurance-backed resilience and redundancy markets.

**Fabrication posture**
- Elite Class-I mobile fleets.
- Outsourced Class-II via bonded partner worlds.
- Limited sovereign Class-III, but superior logistics software.

**Command structure**
- Charter Board -> Risk & Recovery Authority -> Theater Contract Captains.
- Military force tied to performance clauses and indemnity triggers.

**Operational strengths**
- Extremely adaptive supply routing.
- Can finance rapid infrastructure rebuilds.

**Operational weaknesses**
- Loyalty brittle under contract disputes.
- Command unity collapses when liability exposure rises.

---

## 4) Ashfall Communion (AFC)
**Type:** Post-collapse mutualist coalition (city-states + militias)  
**Core Incentive:** Prevent re-centralization of fabrication control after prior genocidal regime.

**Strategic culture**
- Deep distrust of centralized DAL and Class-IV systems.
- Emphasizes local autonomy, redundancy, and low-signature production.

**Fabrication posture**
- Massive Class-0 and Class-I density.
- Minimal Class-II infrastructure by design.
- No formal Class-III or IV ownership.

**Command structure**
- Council Mesh (delegated cells) -> Rotating Campaign Coordinators.
- CRK equivalent is federated and revocable at local level.

**Operational strengths**
- Hard to decapitate.
- Exceptional resilience under occupation/interdiction.

**Operational weaknesses**
- Limited heavy warfighting capacity.
- Inter-cell doctrinal drift reduces interoperability.

---

## 5) The Pale Accord Custodians (PAC)
**Type:** Monastic-technocratic neutral authority (officially non-aligned)  
**Core Incentive:** Preserve baseline safety standards and prevent existential fabrication misuse.

**Strategic culture**
- Frames itself as keeper of civilization continuity.
- Intervenes only when threshold risks are crossed.

**Fabrication posture**
- Small but advanced Class-II sanctuaries.
- Black-box inspection fleets and template forensics labs.
- Hidden contingency Class-III capability rumored, unconfirmed.

**Command structure**
- Synod of Custodians -> Wardens of Lineage -> Audit Envoys.
- Decisions require doctrinal and technical concordance.

**Operational strengths**
- Gold-standard validation and forensic attribution.
- High diplomatic access across hostile blocs.

**Operational weaknesses**
- Limited force projection.
- Perceived bias can trigger multilateral backlash.

## Faction Relationship Axes

### Primary fault lines
1. **Template commons vs proprietary control** (CIS/AFC vs VLCW extremes).
2. **Centralized emergency power vs distributed consent** (DHE vs AFC).
3. **Throughput maximization vs safety primacy** (DHE/VLCW vs PAC).

### Recurring coalitions
- CIS + AFC: defensive legitimacy coalitions against extraction authoritarian expansion.
- DHE + selective VLCW syndicates: transactional wartime supply pacts.
- PAC + any bloc: limited-time crisis stabilization compacts.
