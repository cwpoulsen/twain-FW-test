# Major Factions (Coherence Pass 1)

Status: **Canon-aligned quick reference**  
Authority: `factions/factions-doctrine-ledger-v1.md` (primary), `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`.

---

## 1) Steward Directorate (Earth Core Elite)
**Type:** Bureaucratic ruling caste inside Earth Democracy shell  
**Core incentive:** Preserve civilizational continuity through centralized cognitive governance.

**Strategic posture**
- Uses Consensus-backed policy optimization and class-gated fabrication control.
- Frames coercion as stewardship and safety administration.

**Strengths**
- Institutional depth, legal machinery, queue authority over Class 2.

**Weaknesses**
- Metric dependence, succession friction, legitimacy brittleness when abundance theater fails.

---

## 2) Consensus Operations Complex
**Type:** Algorithmic governance substrate  
**Core incentive:** Minimize instability variance and preserve monopoly continuity.

**Strategic posture**
- Nudging, salience shaping, compliance scoring, narrative harmonization.
- Strongest in dense low-latency Earth networks.

**Strengths**
- Scale, persistence, cross-domain optimization.

**Weaknesses**
- Latency degradation off-core; brittleness in novel social ecologies.

---

## 3) Earth Defense Force (EDF) Command Apparatus
**Type:** Military enforcement architecture  
**Core incentive:** Mission continuity and theater denial under political deniability.

**Strategic posture**
- Uses coerced marine pipeline and governor-module obedience boundaries.
- Prioritizes strategic utility over unit survivability in high-risk operations.

**Strengths**
- Operational reach, formal authority, access to priority transport and logistics channels.

**Weaknesses**
- Morale erosion from deception/disposability logic; fragile trust under prolonged attrition.

---

## 4) Belt Municipal Compacts
**Type:** Local habitat governance blocs  
**Core incentive:** Keep people alive (air, water, heat, hull) under extraction pressure.

**Strategic posture**
- Pragmatic contracts, pooled convoys, maintenance-first politics.
- Will cooperate with Earth when survival-positive; defect when predation becomes explicit.

**Strengths**
- Local legitimacy and practical resilience.

**Weaknesses**
- Corruption risk, fragmented authority, dependence on Earth-class strategic imports.

## 5) Asterion League (Belt Anti-Consensus Bloc)
**Type:** Resistance-federalist coalition with militant wing integration  
**Core incentive:** End remote cognitive sovereignty and secure Belt fabrication sovereignty.

**Strategic posture**
- Information warfare, selective sabotage, convoy interdiction, clandestine support chains.
- Flagship pole: **Asterion Concord**, anti-Consensus techno-sovereignty bloc with first Belt-built Class 1 capability.
- Operates dual track: municipal diplomacy + deep-deniable technical insurgency.
- Confirmed creator of a clandestine **Class 1 seed-fabricator line** (low-throughput, existentially destabilizing).

**Strengths**
- Asymmetric adaptability, political energy, difficult to extinguish fully.
- First credible non-Earth breach of Class 1 monopoly assumptions.

**Weaknesses**
- Internal doctrine splits, civilian blowback risk when tactics escalate.
- Severe vulnerability to precision raids while Class 1 line remains fragile and distributed.

---

## 6) Predatory Belt Actors
**Type:** Criminal syndicates, warlord networks, coercive brokers  
**Core incentive:** Profit and survival in governance vacuum.

**Strategic posture**
- Weaponized scarcity, protection rackets, hostage logistics, maintenance monopolies.

**Strengths**
- Rapid opportunistic adaptation, low scruple flexibility.

**Weaknesses**
- Poor long-horizon governance; invites coalition backlash.

## 7) Persistent Conflict Axes

1. **Steward stability doctrine vs Belt self-determination doctrine**.
2. **EDF mission logic vs marine survival/loyalty logic**.
3. **Consensus variance suppression vs frontier improvisation**.
4. **Municipal pragmatism vs symbolic insurgent escalation**.

Use these axes to keep faction behavior causal rather than episodic.
