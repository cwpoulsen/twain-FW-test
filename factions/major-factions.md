---

## 1) Steward Directorate (Earth Core Elite)
**Type:** Bureaucratic ruling caste operating through democratic shell legitimacy.  
**Strategic objective:** Preserve continuity by monopolizing high-impact decisions, especially class-gated production and legal exception authority.

**How power is applied**
- Converts coercion into procedure (queue policy, compliance law, risk harmonization orders).
- Uses “stability” framing to pre-justify emergency powers.

**Strengths:** deep institutions, legal throughput, Class-2 queue gatekeeping.  
**Weaknesses:** succession rivalry, metric gaming, legitimacy collapse when maintenance reality contradicts messaging.

---

## 2) Consensus Operations Complex
**Type:** Algorithmic governance substrate + social steering infrastructure.  
**Strategic objective:** Minimize variance and preserve regime continuity under imperfect information.

**How power is applied**
- Salience shaping, compliance scoring, and narrative prioritization.
- Best performance in dense Earth networks; degraded efficacy at frontier latency.

**Strengths:** scale, persistence, cross-domain optimization memory.  
**Weaknesses:** brittleness in novel local ecologies and multi-source witness chains.

---

## 3) Earth Defense Fleet (EDF) Command Apparatus
**Type:** Military enforcement architecture with deniable political tasking.  
**Strategic objective:** Maintain theater denial and command continuity at acceptable political cost.

**How power is applied**
- Coerced marine pipelines, governor-module control bands, custody-heavy mission design.
- Narrative after-action control to preserve strategic framing.

**Strengths:** formal force projection, logistics priority, command doctrine depth.  
**Weaknesses:** morale corrosion, trust collapse risk, adaptation lag when local conditions outrun central doctrine.

---

## 4) Belt Municipal Compacts
**Type:** Habitat-level governance blocs and pooled service agreements.  
**Strategic objective:** Keep populations alive via air/water/heat/hull uptime and convoy reliability.

**How power is applied**
- Maintenance-first bargaining, practical coalition contracts, opportunistic alignment.
- Cooperates with Earth when survival-positive, defects when extraction becomes predation.

**Strengths:** local legitimacy, operational pragmatism, repair competence.  
**Weaknesses:** fragmented authority, corruption vectors, strategic import dependence.

---

## 5) Asterion League (Anti-Consensus Belt Bloc)
**Type:** Resistance-federalist coalition with militant and municipal wings.  
**Strategic objective:** End remote cognitive sovereignty and secure Belt fabrication sovereignty.

**How power is applied**
- Dual-track operations: diplomacy with municipalities + deniable technical insurgency.
- Flagship technical wing: **Asterion Concord** with fragile but real Belt-side Class-1 capability.

**Strengths:** asymmetric adaptation, ideological momentum, distributed resilience.  
**Weaknesses:** doctrine splits, civilian blowback risk, vulnerability of early Class-1 throughput base.

---

## 6) Freed Voider Bands (FVB)
**Type:** Ex-EDF rejected-population pirate/mercenary ecology (not a single command tree).  
**Strategic objective:** Survive and profit through convoy predation, coercive brokerage, and deniable contracting.

**How power is applied**
- Recruits from exile/release pipelines, weaponizes maintenance scarcity, and sells temporary force.
- Exploits lane-security seams and trust fractures between municipal and coalition actors.

**Strengths:** rapid adaptation, distributed cells, low political restraint.  
**Weaknesses:** limited long-horizon governance ability, vulnerable to recruitment-funnel disruption + reintegration competition.

---

## 7) Predatory Belt Actors (Non-FVB)
**Type:** Criminal syndicates, racketeers, coercive logistics brokers.  
**Strategic objective:** Convert instability into durable extraction rents.

**How power is applied**
- Hostage logistics, debt traps, maintenance chokepoints, and selective violence.

**Strengths:** opportunism, local intimidation networks.  
**Weaknesses:** poor coalition durability, high backlash exposure when life-support thresholds are crossed.

## 8) Persistent Conflict Axes (Use in Scene Design)
1. Steward continuity doctrine vs Belt sovereignty doctrine.
2. EDF mission utility logic vs marine survivability and loyalty logic.
3. Consensus variance suppression vs frontier improvisation.
4. Municipal maintenance pragmatism vs symbolic insurgent escalation.
5. Anti-predation enforcement vs reintegration legitimacy in FVB-heavy zones.
