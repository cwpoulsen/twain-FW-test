## Faction Definition

**Working name:** Freed Voider Bands (FVB)  
**Composition:** Former EDF personnel who completed/escaped contract pathways but were socially and legally rejected by both Earth and Belt populations.  
**Strategic role:** Cross-theater destabilizers functioning as pirate/mercenary swarms across outer-system lanes.

---

## Canon Lock Integration

1. Crew exits EDF permanently via Blackfly theft (protagonists are not FVB by default).  
2. FVB emerge from broader release/exile pathways and abandonment of coerced veterans.  
3. Strategic reveal: Consensus release pattern intentionally tolerated/steered chronic strife seeding in outer-system transit and port ecologies.

---

## Incentive Structure

### Survival Incentives
- Access to fuel, meds, and maintenance through predation or contract violence.
- Group security replacing failed state protection.

### Identity Incentives
- Shared grievance narrative: “used, freed, then discarded.”
- Rank/status rebuilt through raid competence and reliability under fire.

### Economic Incentives
- Escort extortion, convoy harassment, salvage coercion, covert interdiction contracts.
- Deniable proxy work for factions unwilling to openly violate treaties.

---

## Recruitment Funnel

### Stage R1: Dislocation
Former EDF personnel lose legal standing, work access, and social trust after service.

### Stage R2: Informal Dependency
Reliance on gray-market med, docking, and debt brokers.

### Stage R3: Entry Through “Protection Work”
Small jobs: cargo intimidation, debt enforcement, peripheral escort violence.

### Stage R4: Band Absorption
Operational identity shifts from individual survival to gang/crew loyalty.

### Stage R5: Ideological Hardening
Narrative reframing: systemic betrayal justifies indiscriminate extraction from any polity.

---

## Operational Patterns

1. **Lane nibbling:** repeated low-yield disruptions that increase insurance and route instability.
2. **Contract masquerade:** posing as licensed escorts before predatory turn.
3. **Harbor coercion:** pressure station operators for docking/refit sanctuary.
4. **Proxy deniability:** hired sabotage timed to political negotiations.
5. **Evidence denial:** destroy logs/witness chains to blur attribution.

---

## Threat Taxonomy

- **FVB-R:** Raider bands focused on material seizure.
- **FVB-M:** Mercenary bands under short-term contracts.
- **FVB-H:** Hybrid political-criminal bands with grievance propaganda arms.

All three can overlap. Units are fluid and prone to splintering.

---

## Relationship to Warform Lock

FVB are generally conscious human actors with agency (unlike fully overridden remote warforms). Some contracts may include warform support assets, but faction doctrine and moral framing should distinguish:
- **FVB personnel:** culpable agents.
- **Fully overridden warforms:** non-conscious tactical instruments controlled elsewhere.

---

## How FVB Pressure Protagonists and Major Factions

### Pressure on Protagonists
- Force morally costly triage between anti-Consensus goals and anti-predation obligations.
- Undermine safe-harbor networks through fear economics.
- Complicate free-operator legitimacy (“you are all ex-EDF”) narratives.

### Pressure on Earth/Consensus
- Provides pretext for expanded emergency powers and surveillance.
- Creates controlled chaos useful for anti-coalition framing.

### Pressure on Asterion/Coalitions
- Drains convoy protection capacity.
- Fractures political trust when anti-piracy measures hit civilians.
- Generates accusations of covert sponsorship across member blocs.

---

## Strategic Reveal Path (Books 5-8 Suggested)

1. Initial assumption: FVB are spontaneous criminal spillover.
2. Mid reveal: consistent release/legal patterns feed the same high-risk lanes.
3. Major reveal: internal documents indicate Consensus planners accepted or designed release dynamics to seed persistent outer-system instability.
4. End-state implication: any stable settlement must include veteran reintegration architecture or FVB regeneration continues.

---

## Doctrine Hooks

- Anti-FVB campaigns must pair interdiction with reintegration and labor absorption.
- Pure kill/capture response increases recruitment throughput.
- Convoy defense should include legitimacy protections to avoid becoming collective punishment.

---

## Scene-Writing Rules

1. Avoid monolithic portrayal: show band-level variance in brutality and code.
2. Make material drivers visible (fuel, med debt, repair scarcity).
3. Tie major FVB actions to lane economics and political timing.
4. Show that unresolved veteran exclusion feeds the next band generation.

## Continuity Lock Bundle (Pass 5, compressed)

Apply and do not restate in-scene unless plot-relevant: AI acquired in opening spec-op, databank later for training data; Blackfly crew are permanent post-EDF free operators; post-nuke pursuit is probabilistic dragnet (asset missing, position unknown); full-override warforms are non-conscious remote instruments; FVB destabilizer ecology is tied to Consensus release-pattern intent; small-body actions require anchoring and attitude control.
