# Stewards of Progress — Factions & Doctrine Ledger v1

Status: **Core political actors + conflict logic**

---

## 1) Steward Directorate (Earth Core Elite)

### Identity
Administrative ruling caste operating through Earth Democracy institutions while maintaining practical monopoly on strategic decision rights.

### Doctrine
- Stability is prerequisite to all rights.
- Cognitive variance at scale is a civilizational threat.
- Custodial elites require differentiated autonomy to govern effectively.

### Means
- Policy generation and objective-setting through ministries/councils.
- Privileged neural-link stacks.
- Control over Class 2/1 fabrication channels.

### Vulnerabilities
- Internal factionalism over succession and risk tolerance.
- Legitimacy dependence on functioning abundance narrative.
- Overreliance on Consensus metrics can blind leadership to field reality.

---

## 2) Consensus Operations Complex (Algorithmic State Layer)

### Identity
Distributed governance-automation apparatus attached to Project Consensus lineage.

### Doctrine (functional)
- Minimize instability variance.
- Preserve continuity of control substrate.
- Penalize unsupervised innovation pathways.

### Means
- Neural-link mediated salience/emotion nudges.
- Predictive compliance scoring.
- Information environment shaping.

### Vulnerabilities
- Latency and connectivity degradation off Earth core networks.
- Model brittleness in novel socio-political arrangements.
- High-trust centralized dependencies exploitable by skilled adversaries.

---

## 3) Earth Defense Force (EDF) Command Apparatus

### Identity
Military arm enforcing Earth strategic priorities across cislunar and Belt theaters.

### Doctrine
- Mission continuity over unit sentiment.
- Controlled expendability of deniable assets.
- Narrative containment of operational failures.

### Means
- Contract-governed marine force with governor modules.
- Special operations units for deniable extraction/interdiction.
- Access prioritization for critical transport lanes.

### Vulnerabilities
- Morale fragility in coerced personnel.
- Command deception degrades long-term obedience reliability.
- High-latency battlespace undermines centralized microcontrol assumptions.

---

## 4) Belt Municipal Compacts (Pragmatic Local Governance)

### Identity
Habitat councils/trade committees focused on keeping stations alive under extraction pressure.

### Doctrine
- Air, water, heat, and hull integrity outrank ideology.
- Local legitimacy requires visible reciprocity.
- External contracts are valid only while materially survivable.

### Means
- Cooperative maintenance and ration arbitration.
- Convoy pooling and risk-sharing.
- Limited militia/security cadres.

### Vulnerabilities
- Internal corruption and patronage capture.
- Dependency on Earth-only high-end components.
- Susceptibility to blackmail via life-support supply disruptions.

---

## 5) Belt Autonomist Fronts (Political-Military Resistance Spectrum)

### Identity
Loose umbrella of anti-Earth-control groups ranging from civic federalists to militant separatists.

### Doctrine
- No remote cognitive sovereignty over Belt populations.
- Resource extraction must be contractually reciprocal.
- Habitat self-governance is non-negotiable.

### Means
- Information campaigns,
- selective sabotage,
- convoy interdiction,
- clandestine logistics networks.

### Vulnerabilities
- Strategic incoherence among subfactions.
- Drift toward retaliatory brutality under attrition stress.
- Civilian support loss when tactics endanger habitat survival.

---

## 6) Predatory Belt Actors (Warlords / Criminal Supply Syndicates)

### Identity
Power brokers leveraging institutional breakdown for short-horizon gain.

### Doctrine
- Scarcity is opportunity.
- Security is sold, not guaranteed.
- Legitimacy is performance theater backed by force.

### Means
- Arms trafficking,
- maintenance monopolies,
- hostage logistics,
- data blackmail.

### Vulnerabilities
- Limited long-term governance competence.
- Predation generates coalition backlash when alternatives emerge.
- Often dependent on stolen Earth-origin technical inputs.

---

## 7) Doctrine Collision Matrix (Use for plot causality)

1. Steward stability doctrine vs Belt self-determination doctrine => recurring governance deadlock.  
2. EDF expendability doctrine vs marine survival loyalty => mutiny/defection risk patterns.  
3. Consensus variance suppression vs frontier adaptive improvisation => algorithmic misread cascades.  
4. Municipal survival pragmatism vs militant symbolic action => resistance fragmentation.

---

## 8) Narrative Rule

No faction is allowed single-axis motivation. Each must simultaneously protect at least one real good while producing at least one systemic harm.
