# Black-Market Logistics Economics Dossier v1

Purpose: faction-level illicit-logistics model under latency and scarcity constraints.

## Market Topology of Illicit Logistics
Illicit logistics is a layered service market (brokers, coerced crews, falsifiers, protection actors), not a single bloc. Risk transfer, latency uncertainty, and enforceability drive price more than cargo sticker value.

## Risk Pricing, Insurance Shadows, and Convoy Futures
Shadow insurance and convoy futures price interdiction/betrayal risk; mixed settlement (credits, favors, cargo slots) creates durable dependency networks.

## Port Capture, Toll Governance, and Corruption Equilibria
Port capture emerges through throughput pain exploitation. Anti-capture requires wage realism, hazard pay, rotation, dual-key toll controls, and sequenced intervention (stabilize -> freeze -> prosecute).

## Illicit Fabrication Supply Chains
Fabrication politics are upstream: feedstock purity, calibration authenticity, firmware custody. Canon lock preserved: Blackfly has constrained Class 2 leverage; Asterion League fields fragile Class 1 capacity.

## Recruitment Economies and Exit Pathways
Suppression must include off-ramps (amnesty windows, debt mediation, protected legal work), or recruitment pipelines refill predation networks.

## Reconciled High-Volume Modules (de-duplicated)
### Credit Laundering Through Maintenance Cooperatives
Audit cooperative payroll, parts invoices, and salvage-conversion ledgers against anomaly clusters.

### Counterfeit Medicine Economies and Trust Collapse
Classify med-risk markets separately; prioritize assay access and emergency substitution guarantees.

### Escort Cartels and Violence Derivatives
Cap coercive escort instruments and force disclosure for essential-goods corridor contracts.

### Broker Reputation Graphs and Information Warfare
Maintain broker reliability indices with spoof-resistant provenance and challenge windows.

### Price Transmission Under Sensor Blackouts
Use fallback corridor-price bands to reduce panic spikes during telemetry outages.

### Policy Playbook: Shrinking Illicit Margin Without Starvation
Pair selective enforcement with legal fast lanes, dispute resolution, and livelihood transition.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Finite logistics and uncertainty constraints preserved.
- Freed Voider Bands represented as mixed ecosystem, not monolith.
- Class 2/Class 1 constraints preserved.
- Security response includes recruitment-funnel disruption, not suppression-only.
