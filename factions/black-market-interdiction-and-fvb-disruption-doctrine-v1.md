# Black-Market Interdiction and FVB Disruption Doctrine v1

Purpose: Provide continuity-safe campaign doctrine for degrading black-market violence without collapsing civilian survival networks.

## 1. Interdiction lane: propellant diversion

Mechanism: map the commodity chain from extraction to retail coercion; identify where violence is used as transaction assurance; then replace coercive assurance with enforceable escrow and inspection windows. Interdiction is not only seizure. It is market redesign under conflict conditions.

- Campaign action 1: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 2: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 3: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 4: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 5: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 6: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 7: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 8: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 9: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

- Campaign action 10: mixed civilian-municipal task cell audits manifests, cross-checks thermal wear on containers, and compares declared losses against lane geometry expectations. Divergence triggers targeted holds and witness-protection relocation rather than indiscriminate embargo.

FVB ecology integration: bands are heterogeneous—survivalist, predatory, ideological, contract-driven. Doctrine differentiates recruitment-funnel disruption, financial isolation, and negotiated off-ramps. Suppression-only strategy is treated as self-defeating because it replenishes pirate labor pools.
