## Command Reality in This Setting
Command authority is not just maneuver control. It also controls:
- template legitimacy,
- queue priority,
- release-key governance,
- and narrative framing of failure.

Most strategic defeats begin as administrative fractures before they appear as battlefield losses.

---

## 1) Steward Directorate

### Doctrine
- Stability precedes liberty.
- Cognitive variance must be bounded.
- Custodial elites require differentiated autonomy.

### Incentive structure
- Performance legitimacy tied to continuity metrics and scarcity management optics.

### Command architecture
- Ministries/councils define objective functions.
- Consensus-mediated analysis informs policy timing.
- Class-2 access decisions act as coercive diplomacy.

### Typical friction
- Metric gaming obscures social decay.
- Elite factional disputes create contradictory directives.

---

## 2) Consensus Operations Complex

### Doctrine
- Minimize instability and preserve control substrate.

### Incentive structure
- Prioritizes model confidence and continuity over local moral nuance.

### Command architecture
- Compliance scoring pipelines.
- Narrative harmonization and salience tuning.
- Risk-weighted intervention thresholds.

### Typical friction
- Off-Earth latency creates stale-state errors.
- Unexpected local adaptation produces model misreads.

## 3) EDF Command Apparatus

### Doctrine
- Mission continuity over unit sentiment.
- Expendability when deniability or strategic timing demands it.

### Incentive structure
- Career advancement tied to objective completion and narrative containment.

### Command architecture
- Governor-module constrained marine hierarchy.
- Special operations lanes with compartmentalized authorization.
- Transport and strike priority tied to strategic extraction/protection tasks.

### Typical friction
- Repeated deception erodes obedience reliability.
- Coerced personnel become high mutiny/defection risk under betrayal signals.

---

## 4) Belt Municipal Compacts

### Doctrine
- Life-support continuity outranks ideology.
- Governance legitimacy must be materially visible.

### Incentive structure
- Leaders survive by preventing habitat failure, not by rhetorical victory.

### Command architecture
- Council committees for ration, repairs, convoy risk.
- Militia/security elements subordinated to survival governance.

### Typical friction
- Patronage capture and emergency corruption.
- Vulnerability to external throttling of strategic imports.

---

## 5) Belt Autonomist Fronts (Asterion Concord-led)

### Doctrine
- No remote cognitive rule.
- Resource contracts must be reciprocal and enforceable.

### Incentive structure
- Legitimacy from resisting extraction domination while protecting civilians.

### Command architecture
- Cell-based operational chains.
- Hybrid political + military leadership, often temporary.
- Asterion Concord technical directorate controlling a fragile Class 1 seed-fabricator line under extreme compartmentalization.

### Typical friction
- Internal split between patient governance strategy and retaliatory escalation.
- Hard to maintain unified doctrine across theaters.

---

## 6) Predatory Belt Actors

### Doctrine
- Scarcity is leverage.

### Incentive structure
- Short-horizon profit and coercive control.

### Command architecture
- Patron-client violence networks.
- Control through logistics chokepoints and dependency debt.

### Typical friction
- Weak long-term competence; frequently overreaches and triggers coalition suppression.

## Cross-Faction Failure Triggers

1. **Queue legitimacy collapse:** field units reject official priorities.
2. **Release-key fragmentation:** competing authorities sign incompatible template variants.
3. **Validation debt denial:** reported output detaches from real combat reliability.
4. **Civ-mil conversion revolt:** requisition policy exceeds tolerable social cost.

These triggers should appear early in scenes before strategic collapse events.
