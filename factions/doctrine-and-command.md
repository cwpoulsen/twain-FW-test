# Faction Doctrine, Incentives, and Command Mechanics

## Command in Fabrication War
Classical command controls maneuver. In this setting, command must also control **template legitimacy, queue priority, and conversion policy**. Command failure is usually administrative before tactical.

## Concord of Iron Spans (CIS)

### Doctrine
- **Elastic Containment:** absorb first strike, preserve infrastructure, then counter with validated high-reliability waves.
- **Interoperable Deep Defense:** coalition units share schema and modular interfaces.

### Incentive model
- Electoral accountability + member-world burden sharing.
- Strategic goal: prevent single-actor control of interstellar fabrication chokepoints.

### Command architecture
- Theater Marshals propose campaign templates.
- War Throughput Directorate sequences production priorities.
- Senate Emergency Committee can issue time-limited expedited CRKs.

### Friction points
- Civilian veto can block urgent adaptation.
- Alliance politics can overprotect symbolic worlds at operational cost.

## Directorate of Helion Extraction (DHE)

### Doctrine
- **Shock Saturation:** mass early output to break opposing logistics confidence.
- **Corridor Seizure:** secure extraction and transit nodes before diplomatic pressure consolidates.

### Incentive model
- Regime legitimacy tied to visible industrial output metrics.
- Elite advancement determined by quota overachievement.

### Command architecture
- Sector Procurators have both military and industrial police powers.
- Production Security Bureau embeds auditors in every Class-II complex.
- Emergency authority can suspend validation thresholds.

### Friction points
- Fear-driven reporting inflates readiness claims.
- Purges remove dissenting engineers who would flag latent defects.

## Vesper League of Contract Worlds (VLCW)

### Doctrine
- **Portfolio Warfare:** diversify risk across theaters, contractors, and supply chains.
- **Denial by Price:** make adversary operations economically unsustainable.

### Incentive model
- Shareholder value and contract compliance are co-equal with military outcomes.
- Decision speed linked to actuarial certainty rather than battlefield urgency.

### Command architecture
- Contract Captains hold mission authority bounded by liability clauses.
- Risk & Recovery Authority dynamically reprices support based on threat models.
- Arbitration cells adjudicate inter-corporate disputes mid-campaign.

### Friction points
- Legal disputes pause critical action windows.
- Contractors may hoard best templates for premium clients.

## Ashfall Communion (AFC)

### Doctrine
- **Diffuse Persistence:** never present a single high-value target.
- **Local Sufficiency Cells:** each district can maintain baseline defense independently.

### Incentive model
- Historical trauma prevention: no return to centralized extermination machinery.
- Community legitimacy outranks strategic efficiency.

### Command architecture
- Campaign Coordinators elected for fixed, short mandates.
- Template approvals require multi-cell witness and revocation channels.
- Militia councils control local queue priorities.

### Friction points
- Slow consensus for heavy, coordinated offensives.
- Regional cultural norms create incompatible operating procedures.

---

## Pale Accord Custodians (PAC)

### Doctrine
- **Threshold Intervention:** engage only when systemic risk exceeds accepted civilization hazard bands.
- **Lineage Integrity:** preserve provenance, detect tampering, and enforce forensic truth.

### Incentive model
- Institutional purpose built around long-horizon species survival.
- Political neutrality pursued as strategic asset.

### Command architecture
- Audit Envoys issue risk findings that can trigger embargo recommendations.
- Synod authorizes direct intervention with supermajority.
- Wardens of Lineage control access to trusted baseline templates.

### Friction points
- Slow deliberation under rapidly escalating crises.
- Neutrality stance interpreted as complicity by all sides at different times.

## Cross-Faction Command Failure Triggers
1. **Queue Legitimacy Crisis:** field units distrust priority decisions and self-provision from black markets.
2. **CRK Fragmentation:** competing authorities sign conflicting template variants.
3. **Metric Gaming:** reported throughput diverges from deployable combat quality.
4. **Civ-Mil Conversion Revolt:** civilians refuse wartime industrial requisition.

## Practical Continuity Hooks
- CIS may win a battle but lose a campaign if Senate freezes emergency key issuance.
- DHE can seize corridors quickly, then stall when VDI-driven failures spike.
- VLCW may appear neutral while effectively deciding war tempo through insurance exclusions.
- AFC can survive occupation indefinitely yet struggle to project force beyond home systems.
- PAC audits can delegitimize major arsenals and trigger sudden coalition shifts.
