# Faction Doctrine and Command Mechanics (Coherence Pass 1)

## Voice & Authority Lock (Wave 10)
- Use canonical actor names only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.
- Write in consequence-first cadence: mechanism -> decision -> cost.
- Preserve hard constraints: no miracle throughput, no real-time Earth command outside latency limits, no zero-cost victories.

## Command Reality in This Setting
Command authority here is not just who moves troops on a tac-map. It controls the four artifacts that decide whether a force can function tomorrow:
- template legitimacy (which fab schema is treated as lawful),
- queue priority (who gets wafer/reactor time this week),
- release-key signatures (whose cryptographic authority unlocks production),
- and after-action narrative custody (whose report becomes legal truth).

Most strategic defeats start as signature mismatch in an operations packet, then appear 40-120 days later as failed bearings, dead med queues, and mutiny trials.

## 1) Steward Directorate

### Doctrine
- Stability precedes liberty.
- Cognitive variance must be bounded.
- Custodial elites require differentiated autonomy.

### Incentive structure
- Performance legitimacy tied to continuity metrics and scarcity management optics.

### Command architecture
- Weekly ministry objective packets are signed every 0400 Monday UTC and propagated as ranked KPI trees to regional directors.
- Consensus produces confidence-banded timing windows; low-confidence windows are usually delayed rather than risked.
- Class-2 queue tickets are used as coercive diplomacy: grant 72-hour priority to allies, push rivals into 30-60 day slip bands.

### Typical friction
- Metric gaming obscures social decay.
- Elite factional disputes create contradictory directives.

---

## 2) Consensus Operations Complex

### Doctrine
- Minimize instability and preserve control substrate.

### Incentive structure
- Prioritizes model confidence and continuity over local moral nuance.

### Command architecture
- Compliance scoring pipelines.
- Narrative harmonization and salience tuning.
- Risk-weighted intervention thresholds.

### Typical friction
- Off-Earth latency creates stale-state errors.
- Unexpected local adaptation produces model misreads.

---

## 3) EDF Command Apparatus

### Doctrine
- Mission continuity over unit sentiment.
- Controlled expendability when deniability windows or political timing demand a sacrificial unit.

### Incentive structure
- Career advancement tied to objective completion and narrative containment.

### Command architecture
- Governor-module constrained marine hierarchy with obedience bands enforced at squad leader, platoon net, and theater relay levels.
- Special operations lanes use two-key mission unlocks (Steward + EDF legal), creating deliberate accountability blur.
- Transport/strike slots are allocated through extraction-protection scoreboards; units guarding reactor feedstock outrank casualty evacuation unless overruled.

### Typical friction
- Repeated deception erodes obedience reliability.
- Coerced personnel become high mutiny/defection risk under betrayal signals.

---

## 4) Belt Municipal Compacts

### Doctrine
- Life-support continuity outranks ideology.
- Governance legitimacy must be materially visible.

### Incentive structure
- Leaders survive by preventing habitat failure, not by rhetorical victory.

### Command architecture
- Council committees for ration, repairs, convoy risk.
- Militia/security elements subordinated to survival governance.

### Typical friction
- Patronage capture and emergency corruption.
- Vulnerability to external throttling of strategic imports.

---

## 5) Asterion League (Asterion Concord technical wing-led)

### Doctrine
- No remote cognitive rule.
- Resource contracts must be reciprocal and enforceable.

### Incentive structure
- Legitimacy from resisting extraction domination while protecting civilians.

### Command architecture
- Cell-based operational chains.
- Hybrid political + military leadership, often temporary.
- Asterion League technical directorate (Asterion Concord wing) controlling a fragile Class 1 seed-fabricator line under extreme compartmentalization.

### Typical friction
- Internal split between patient governance strategy and retaliatory escalation.
- Hard to maintain unified doctrine across theaters.

---

## 6) Predatory Belt Actors

### Doctrine
- Scarcity is leverage.

### Incentive structure
- Short-horizon profit and coercive control.

### Command architecture
- Patron-client violence networks.
- Control through logistics chokepoints and dependency debt.

### Typical friction
- Weak long-term competence; frequently overreaches and triggers coalition suppression.

## Cross-Faction Failure Triggers

1. **Queue legitimacy collapse:** deck crews and field commands stop believing published priorities and run shadow queues.
2. **Release-key fragmentation:** rival authorities sign incompatible template branches; maintenance turns into roulette.
3. **Validation debt denial:** dashboard readiness diverges from combat reliability until whole units fail at once.
4. **Civ-mil conversion revolt:** requisition crosses survival red lines and municipal populations refuse further levy support.

These triggers should appear early in scenes before strategic collapse events.
