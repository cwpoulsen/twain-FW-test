# Faction Failure Modes and Escalation Paths

## Why Wars End in This Setting
Fabrication wars are less often decided by singular decisive battles and more by cascading failures in trust, throughput, and social consent. This file defines canonical breakdown pathways for each major faction.

## CIS Failure Modes

### 1. Procedural Paralysis
- Trigger: coalition dispute over emergency template release.
- Early signs: rising blue-delay, ad hoc local workarounds.
- Outcome: tactical units operate on stale configurations and lose adaptation race.

### 2. Burden-Split Backlash
- Trigger: perception that frontier members absorb disproportionate casualties.
- Early signs: reserve mobilization refusals, strikes in core worlds.
- Outcome: alliance coherence fractures; rival blocs exploit legitimacy gap.

### 3. Validation Overconservatism
- Trigger: rigid QA standards maintained despite existential tempo pressure.
- Early signs: stockpiles healthy but frontline shortages persist.
- Outcome: loses initiative to lower-quality, higher-volume adversary.

## DHE Failure Modes

### 1. Validation Debt Cascade
- Trigger: repeated emergency waivers to maximize output.
- Early signs: unexplained field breakdown clusters, rising maintenance burden.
- Outcome: sudden simultaneous failures across weapon families.

### 2. Purge Spiral
- Trigger: leadership attributes setbacks to disloyalty rather than design or logistics defects.
- Early signs: engineer disappearances, falsified readiness reports.
- Outcome: epistemic collapse; command cannot trust internal metrics.

### 3. Extraction Overreach
- Trigger: expansion beyond defendable corridor depth.
- Early signs: convoy loss rates spike, local insurgency rises.
- Outcome: resource gains become net negative due to security overhead.

## VLCW Failure Modes

### 1. Contractual Fracture
- Trigger: liability disputes under wartime ambiguity.
- Early signs: arbitration queues exceed operational planning cycles.
- Outcome: command pauses while legal process lags battlefield reality.

### 2. Reputation Liquidity Crash
- Trigger: failure to honor reconstruction guarantees after high-profile losses.
- Early signs: insurance withdrawal, bond spreads explode.
- Outcome: logistics financing collapses faster than material capacity.

### 3. Proprietary Isolation
- Trigger: refusal to share critical template patches without premium pricing.
- Early signs: allied resentment, shadow reverse-engineering cells emerge.
- Outcome: coalition exclusion and retaliatory IP seizure.

---

## AFC Failure Modes

### 1. Coordination Entropy
- Trigger: prolonged multi-theater pressure requiring synchronized heavy operations.
- Early signs: conflicting local doctrines, incompatible template branches.
- Outcome: strategic opportunities missed despite high local resilience.

### 2. Heavy-Capability Deficit
- Trigger: adversary deploys sustained siege platforms and orbital denial.
- Early signs: local victories but inability to dislodge entrenched enemy assets.
- Outcome: attritional exhaustion and negotiated concessions.

### 3. Ideological Gatekeeping
- Trigger: strict anti-centralization rules block necessary temporary unification.
- Early signs: emergency councils dissolve without actionable mandates.
- Outcome: defensive success without strategic endgame.

---

## PAC Failure Modes

### 1. Neutrality Delegitimization
- Trigger: major blocs interpret audit timing as politically selective.
- Early signs: denied access, diplomatic expulsions.
- Outcome: forensic authority erodes; standards become optional.

### 2. Capacity Mismatch
- Trigger: simultaneous crises exceed envoy and inspection fleet bandwidth.
- Early signs: long audit backlogs, inconsistent enforcement.
- Outcome: catastrophic misuse events slip through oversight gaps.

### 3. Doctrinal Rigidity
- Trigger: refusal to adapt legacy safety thresholds to novel war technologies.
- Early signs: irrelevant advisories ignored by all parties.
- Outcome: institution remains principled but strategically sidelined.

## Escalation Ladder (Inter-Faction)

### Stage 0: Gray Contest
- Cyber probing, sanctions, extraction rights disputes, template espionage.

### Stage 1: Throughput Skirmish
- Limited strikes on logistics nodes and DAL mirrors; deniable sabotage.

### Stage 2: Theater Industrial War
- Open attacks on Class-II/III infrastructure and feedstock corridors.

### Stage 3: Sovereign Destabilization
- Attempts to fracture CRK governance and induce civil-military split.

### Stage 4: Existential Protocols
- Deployment of civilization-risk systems (self-replicating fab swarms, lineage-wipe malware).
- PAC threshold intervention most likely here.

## Cross-Faction De-escalation Levers
1. **Mutual Audit Windows:** temporary joint inspections under PAC mediation.
2. **Template Safe Harbor:** protected exchange of non-offensive repair standards.
3. **Civilian Service Guarantees:** minimum power/water carve-outs to reduce revolt pressure.
4. **Queue Transparency Accords:** publish priority rules to blunt propaganda and mistrust.

These levers matter because most late-stage collapses are political-technical trust failures, not lack of hardware.
