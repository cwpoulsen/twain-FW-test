- 04:35 EST — Chris changed project title preference to **"Stewards of Progress"**.
- 04:55 EST — Chris selected **"Consensus"** as the AI name direction (cold/government cryptic influence vibe).
- 04:56 EST — Chris confirmed the AI naming is **derived from Project Consensus**.
- 05:09 EST — Core thematic direction established: **Consensus** lacks creativity and enforces conformity/coercion; **Stewards** (bureaucratic class) author rules that entrench power pyramids under conditions of abundance. Desired reader effect: show (not tell) rising social cognitive dissonance, stress-fractures in public behavior, and brief glimmers of humanity in one-on-one moments that collapse under groupthink.
- 05:28 EST — Expanded world baseline: basic needs met at low-quality ceiling (bland plant-based food variants, lukewarm-only water, cramped free housing), no meaningful leisure/vacations, propaganda-dominant scripted "reality" media, rationed alcohol at public belief-reaffirmation gatherings, collapse of authentic art/theater and utilitarian architecture, covert rationing hidden under simulated consumer abundance and deceptive packaging.
- 05:36 EST — Story setting clarified: main narrative is off-Earth with an Earth Defense Force Marine squad (free-thinker cohort). Earth dystopia enters via character memory/backstory. Non-implanted citizens face social isolation and dispersed housing among indoctrinated populace; military service offers an escape into brotherhood at the moral cost of suppressing/violently policing unruly Belt miners.
- 05:39 EST — Marine control/contract mechanics defined: squad loyalty is primarily internal (to each other), but each Marine carries a governor module enforcing simple hard rules (obey orders or termination). Service term is 5 years; completion grants legal freedom but permanent banishment from Earth.
- 05:41 EST — Operational constraint refined: Marines retain limited interpersonal freedom (can converse/bond), with all communications monitored; tactical reality requires self-preservation combat performance while command obedience remains mandatory.
- 06:xx EST — Character ensemble direction (5 EDF Marines): two comparatively well-conditioned non-linked characters (male MC + female counterpart) with growing sexual tension; three others carry emotional regulation deficits tied to conformity-first/low-nurture upbringing.
- 06:xx EST — Plot-launch scene concept: squad en route to Belt engagement, resentment over lack of powered armor, CO (implanted; governor-module authority) privately informs sergeant/MC he will not join mission. Established prior history includes MC previously saving CO in combat. Mission objective is cover/extraction of a high-value asset at all costs, signaling probable suicide assignment for squad.
- 21:10 EST — Expanded inciting combat sequence: CO shows first humanity leak (tear) while granting sergeant command-channel access; drop into intense firefight; sergeant overhears post-extraction nuke order (codeword), realizing squad disposal. Team moves toward Blackfly stealth ship as Spec Ops extracts medium cargo crate; betrayal at ramp (rifles aimed, forced into ditch) interrupted by sudden neutralization of powered-armored operators and urgent encrypted voice inviting embark. Liv (corporal) pilots emergency escape; full-burn departure, heading broadcast, power cut after nuclear detonation shock/plasma wave passes, ship coasts dark into deep space.
- 21:13 EST — Process directive from Chris: treat the above as **First Act assembly notes only**; remain in worldbuilding/system-building mode and do not prompt for prose drafting unless explicitly requested.
- 21:15 EST — End-of-day save request: perform full update pass across notes/canon; morning agenda includes collaborative SOUL.md refinement.
