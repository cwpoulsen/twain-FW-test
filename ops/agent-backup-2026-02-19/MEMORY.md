## Project Canon — Writing Universe (Stewards of Progress)

### Core Character Naming (Locked)
- Protagonist: **Staff Sergeant John Hale**
- Team member: **Private Lindsay "Lin" Veil**
- Team member: **Marko Branik**
- Team member: **Isaac Beckham**

### Book 1 Structural Anchor (Locked)
- A major **databank raid** scene is placed roughly **1/3 to 1/2 through Book 1** (not first free-team engagement).
- Function: mission success with heavy moral cost; establishes long-tail tone for the series.

### Tone/Doctrine Direction (Locked)
- Escalating superior-force enemy pressure drives protagonist forces farther from Earth.
- Tactical pattern trends toward **defensive posture + fighting retreat** conditions.
- Ethical priority increasingly shifts to **human life over convenience/speed/personal safety**.

### Dialogue Register Progression (Locked)
- Early book uses stronger military formality (rank/surname address).
- As crew cohesion deepens, dialogue transitions to more informal first-name usage and less decorum.

### Lin Veil — Current Locked Role Foundation
- Shipboard sensors/astrogation specialist with high math fluency.
- Strong movement-intent intuition and anomaly/failure-mode detection.
- Anti-groupthink asset.
- Tactical pairing: Veil identifies exits/failure modes; Hale operationalizes.
- Emotional weakness direction currently centered on hyper-empathy + people-pleasing burden.

### Process Decision
- Lin is intentionally **parked at working depth** (with placeholders) until remaining two team characters are developed; then refine her backstory/arc to support full crew dynamics.

### Team Thematic Identity (Locked Direction)
- Core team represents **the best remaining human variance**: ambition-followers, heart-led outliers, and independent thinkers who resisted consensus conformity.
- Their difference functioned as a social/political exile vector: they were effectively banished from Earth for nonconformity.
- Shared psychological throughline: each seeks companionship after isolating, destabilizing formative experiences.
- Shared internal wound: each carries defect-shame (belief that something is wrong with them).
- Generational significance: they are first-generation adults raised fully under Consensus conditions who nevertheless escaped its cognitive/social capture.

### New Arc/Tech Direction (Locked Addition)
- The liberated box/cargo includes a **new AI seed/system** (major long-arc catalyst).
- A named anti-Consensus Belt faction (name TBD in canon docs; must not use generic “Belters”) has achieved **Class 1 fabricator** capability.
- The Blackfly carries a **Class 2 fabricator**, creating a combined fabrication pathway that materially shifts Belt strategic power potential.
- Macro series direction extends to an approximately **10-book** reconquest arc (Earth first, then wider solar-system reclamation).
- Navigation/propulsion canon must include realistic fusion-efficiency assumptions, thrust envelopes, trajectory models, and travel-time tables for core lanes.
