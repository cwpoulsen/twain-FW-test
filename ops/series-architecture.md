# Series Architecture v1

## Model
**Episodic Amazon Unlimited-style SF series**

Each book should deliver a satisfying standalone mission/problem arc while advancing a controlled long-game backdrop.

## Structural Rules
1. Every book has a clear self-contained conflict and resolution.
2. Continuity rewards repeat readers, but entry remains friendly for new readers.
3. Character evolution is cumulative across episodes.
4. Macro-lore advances in deliberate increments (no chaos jumps).
5. Endings should close the main episode while opening one compelling forward hook.

## Episode Blueprint (Per Book)
- Cold open / inciting disruption
- Problem framing + constraints
- Escalation through tactical complications
- Midpoint reveal or systems shift
- High-pressure resolution sequence
- Aftermath + serialized hook

## KU Cadence Considerations
- Fast engagement in first 1-2 chapters
- Frequent payoff beats to sustain momentum
- Clear stakes and practical mission language
- Minimal exposition dumps; distribute worldbuilding through action

## Continuity Contract
- Core canon never drifts.
- Soft canon may adapt with explicit updates.
- Rumors are sandbox-safe for mystery and future pivots.
