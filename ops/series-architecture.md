# Series Architecture v1

## Model
**Hybrid Episodic Amazon Unlimited-style SF series**

Primary structure is episodic (standalone mission/problem arc per book), layered over a long-form macro arc that compounds across installments.

Spinoff lines are first-class citizens: side-series can branch from characters, factions, theaters, or timeline windows without breaking mainline canon.

## Structural Rules
1. Every book has a clear self-contained conflict and resolution.
2. Continuity rewards repeat readers, but entry remains friendly for new readers.
3. Character evolution is cumulative across episodes.
4. Macro-lore advances in deliberate increments (no chaos jumps).
5. Endings should close the main episode while opening one compelling forward hook.
6. Mainline books feed a macro spine; no installment is narratively disposable.
7. Spinoffs must be canon-compatible and timeline-addressable via shared IDs/events.

## Episode Blueprint (Per Book)
- Cold open / inciting disruption
- Problem framing + constraints
- Escalation through tactical complications
- Midpoint reveal or systems shift
- High-pressure resolution sequence
- Aftermath + serialized hook

## KU Cadence Considerations
- Fast engagement in first 1-2 chapters
- Frequent payoff beats to sustain momentum
- Clear stakes and practical mission language
- Minimal exposition dumps; distribute worldbuilding through action

## Continuity Contract
- Core canon never drifts.
- Soft canon may adapt with explicit updates.
- Rumors are sandbox-safe for mystery and future pivots.
