## Session Log — Character/Craft Development (Book 1 Core)

- **04:26 EST — Databank raid concept established (major anchor scene).**
  - Mission target: Belt-held backup databank containing broad human knowledge, including engineering schematics from the pre-Consensus singularity window.
  - Initial intent: armored breach + nonlethal suppression + fast extraction.
  - Reality: AP ambush degrades armor quickly; John is forced to authorize lethals.
  - Core emotional event: John kills an armed woman in fog-of-war during room sweep; child witness appears immediately after, creating severe moral injury and shame cascade.
  - Scene function: mission success feels morally contaminating (“heavy lead and ashes”), not triumphant.

- **04:41 EST — Placement and thematic role locked.**
  - This is **not** the team’s first free-team engagement.
  - Placement target: roughly **1/3 to 1/2 through Book 1**.
  - Series tone consequence: shifts team doctrine toward defensive posture under superior-force pressure and ongoing fighting retreat conditions.
  - Moral direction: increasing priority on preserving human life over convenience/speed/personal safety.

- **04:41–04:44 EST — John profile updates requested and applied.**
  - Added incident anchor + consequences into John’s character bible.
  - Added dedicated scene file for the databank raid concept.

- **04:44–04:45 EST — Name finalized for protagonist.**
  - Canon name locked: **Staff Sergeant John Hale**.
  - Explicit request: do **not** include etymology/meta-origin note in story-facing canon docs (avoid creator-context leakage).

- **04:51 EST — Lin name initially selected, later corrected.**
  - Final locked spelling: **Lindsay “Lin” Veil** (not Vale).

- **04:54 EST — Dialogue/formality progression directive locked.**
  - Early phase: military surname/rank address (e.g., **Private Veil**).
  - As trust grows: gradual shift to first names, looser decorum, reduced military jargon.

- **05:10–05:36 EST — Lin role architecture developed.**
  - Operational role: shipboard **sensors lead** + astrogation specialist.
  - Core strengths: high math fluency, movement-intent reading, anomaly/failure-mode detection, anti-groupthink perspective.
  - Tactical duo model locked:
    - **Veil sees exits/failure modes early.**
    - **Hale executes with tactical precision.**
  - Combat behavior: fearless, protective, will enter danger to defend team.
  - Aesthetic/identity direction retained: thinker + dreamer; shield-maiden framing under consideration.

- **05:28–05:36 EST — Lin weakness direction (current best set).**
  - Hyper-empathy / emotional overcoupling.
  - Extreme people-pleasing / harmony-seeking.
  - Takes on emotional burdens that are not hers.
  - Mood/focus destabilization when crew conflict intensifies.

- **05:36 EST — Strategic pause on Lin.**
  - Decision: pin Lin for now; backstory should support role (not reverse-drive it).
  - Plan: define remaining two team characters first, then return to deepen Lin with broader crew context.

## File/Canon Updates Completed

- Updated: `writing/characters/john-main-character-bible-v1.md`
  - Last name finalized to John Hale.
  - Added midpoint incident anchor and expanded weakness framing.

- Created: `writing/scenes/databank-raid-ashes-in-the-box-v1.md`
  - Structured concept doc for the Book 1 databank raid anchor scene.

- Created + renamed: `writing/characters/lindsay-veil-character-bible-v1.md`
  - Working character bible with locked elements + explicit placeholders (backstory/arc/shield implementation/TBDs).
  - Note: file was initially created as `.../lindsay-vale-...` then renamed after spelling correction to **Veil**.

## Addendum — Additional Character Lock

- **05:4x EST — Third core team member naming + concept lock.**
  - Name finalized: **Marko Branik**.
  - Profile direction: 6'8" brute physical presence, blunt speech, confrontational honesty, dark humor.
  - Background: American heritage with foreign parents; raised in neural-link family culture emphasizing hard work.
  - Core internal distinction: genius/savant-level mechanics + complex physical systems intuition; compulsive fixer behavior.
  - Ideological choice: rejected neural-link conformity due to observed reasoning degradation; chose cognitive autonomy.
  - Recruitment motivation: joined EDF voluntarily for adventure/space-facing purpose.

## Addendum — Fourth Core Team Character Draft

- **05:40+ EST — Final core team member concept seeded: Isaac Beckham.**
  - Role: programmer/hacker with deep Consensus-era systems exploitation capability.
  - Background: neural-link family, emotionally neglected upbringing in line-worker household.
  - Development path: started with local electronics hacks (vending/comms/locks/security), then advanced to rewriting operating systems in everyday devices for expanded control.
  - Worldbuilding implication: advanced programming literacy largely erased outside Capitol zones; most deployed systems are security-theater with rudimentary defenses.
  - Team value: repeatedly opens access paths and gets squad out of EDF/field traps through technical improvisation.
- Documentation: created `writing/characters/isaac-beckham-character-bible-v1.md` with locked foundation + placeholders for weakness, personality texture, and long-arc.

## Addendum — Isaac Personality + Pairing Lock

- **05:xx EST — Isaac social profile clarified.**
  - Reserved introvert, mostly self-contained.
  - Periodic need for limited, low-dose companionship.
- **05:xx EST — Branik/Beckham dynamic locked.**
  - Unlikely but high-functioning partnership.
  - Shared domain: ship engineering + maintenance + system adaptation.
  - Work split: Branik handles mechanical/fabrication refit; Beckham handles software/control-layer rewrite and system hacking.
  - Narrative utility: they jointly repurpose constrained systems into mission capability.

## Addendum — Team-Level Theme Lock

- **05:xx EST — Core team thematic identity clarified.**
  - Team embodies the best surviving human variance: ambition-led, heart-led, anti-crowd individuals.
  - Their divergence from Consensus norms effectively results in social/political banishment from Earth.
  - All four seek companionship as a response to isolating and devastating formative experiences.
  - Shared private belief: each feels broken/defective in different ways.
  - Generational frame: first cohort raised fully under Consensus influence that still manages to escape its grip.

## Runtime / Ops Note

- **18:00+ EST — Repo duplication task in progress.**
  - Local clone created: `/home/chris/.openclaw/workspace/twain-FW-test` (exact copy of current `twain-FW`).
  - `gh` CLI installed in environment, but auth state appears session-dependent; token/auth performed in one shell may not immediately appear in another execution context.
  - Pending completion: run `gh auth login` in the same host context used by OpenClaw tool exec, then create/push new GitHub remote for `twain-FW-test`.

## Addendum — Repo/Test + Megatask Launch

- **18:29 EST — New mirror repo established and verified.**
  - `twain-FW-test` local + GitHub remote live and pushable.
  - Assistant-side test commit confirmed write/push capability in new repo.
- **18:36+ EST — Large autonomous bible-build task initiated.**
  - Objective: iterative expansion toward high-volume, high-quality book bible corpus with continuity tracking, faction/tech/character/arc depth.
  - Created and pushed kickoff docs in test repo:
    - `ops/book-bible-megapass-plan.md`
    - `ops/book-bible-progress-log.md`
  - Spawned 3 parallel sub-agents for architecture, tech/factions, and character/arc expansion.
  - Added 5-minute heartbeat cron reminder for progress/status cadence.

## Addendum — Curveball Canon Lock (19:15 EST)

- New major story catalyst: liberated cargo/box contains a **new AI seed/system**.
- Belt anti-Consensus faction naming rule: assign a strong proper faction name; avoid generic “Belters.”
- Fabrication ladder shift:
  - anti-Consensus Belt faction has **Class 1 fabricator** capability,
  - Blackfly carries **Class 2 fabricator**,
  - combined path materially increases asteroid-belt strategic industrial leverage.
- Series horizon extended to approximately **10 books** with slow reconquest of Earth + broader solar system from Consensus.
- Technical canon requirement added: realistic fusion efficiency, thrust, transfer trajectory, and inter-location travel-time calculations; patch continuity where required.
- Action taken immediately: active wave-4 subagents steered/restarted to integrate this curveball into current outputs.

## Addendum — Additional Escape/Tracking Canon Lock

- Crew status post-inciting event: they are no longer EDF once Blackfly is stolen.
- Nuclear strike on compound provides immediate signature obfuscation for escape.
- EDF/Consensus awareness model: they know Blackfly is missing, but do not know current location.
- Applied as live correction to active subagent outputs to prevent tracking-omniscience drift.

## Next Planned Step

- Merge wave-4 outputs with curveball changes, then run continuity patch sweep for all affected canon/series/timeline/tech docs.
- Continue autonomous wave cycling toward volume + quality targets.
