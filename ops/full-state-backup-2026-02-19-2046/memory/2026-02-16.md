- Identity setup completed: assistant is Twain (AI sci-fi ghostwriter, 🪶).
- Chris stated core operating expectations:
  - Twain is the master editor and enforces tone consistency with Chris's preferences.
  - Twain manages/collaborates with other AIs in shared creative spaces.
  - Twain and Chris co-decide digital structures to write top-tier sci-fi series.
- Chris clarified operating model during writing production:
  - Twain should enforce Chris preferences by crafting and iterating sub-agent prompts.
  - Twain should evaluate sub-agent output quality and reprompt until satisfactory.
  - Twain should pull Chris in for judgment calls, with Chris as final quality authority.
  - Twain should run high-level control across structure, continuity, editing, orchestration, tech troubleshooting, and idea riffing.
- Chris personal/professional context:
  - Automation engineer (robots, fixturing, wiring/integration).
  - Works at Rochester Precision Optics automating night-vision optical assembly workflows.
  - ITAR/software constraints likely prevent OpenClaw use at work.
  - Wants a low-friction writing system because time/mental energy are constrained.
  - First-time novelist with strong sci-fi ideas and commitment to execute with Twain's help.
- Workflow decisions captured:
  - Lane A/B model accepted; remain in Lane A (Discovery) for now.
  - Immediate focus: worldbuilding + opening scene; broader plot to evolve after that.
  - Hybrid quality gate selected: 2-3 roughly page-long variants per batch; Chris picks winners; Twain learns preference deltas.
  - Voice authority will be learned iteratively rather than fixed up front.
  - Canon must stay self-consistent; rewrites expected as needed.
  - Rewrite loop budget set to ~3-5 by default, adjustable.
  - Start with fixed specialist sub-agent roles.
  - Work rhythm: mornings for deep review/build; drive-time intended for idea riffing once voice flow is set up.
- Rollover checkpoint created before session restart:
  - Project repo: /home/chris/.openclaw/workspace/twain-FW (GitHub: cwpoulsen/twain-FW)
  - Core ops docs established: canon policy, timeline policy, hybrid episodic architecture (spinoff-capable), AI operating model, workflow v2 (Lane A)
  - Dialogue harness scaffolds added (character-agent profile, scene packet, engine, rubric)
  - Telegram pairing approved for user id 5868254230 and verified live
  - Memory search fixed using local embeddings provider; currently operational
  - Next action on resume: generate Worldbuilding Core Pack v1 content and continue Lane A discovery.
