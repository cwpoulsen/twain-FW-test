- **Name:** Chris
- **What to call them:** Chris
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:** America/New_York
- **Notes:**
  - Works as an automation engineer (robot programming, fixturing design/fabrication, wiring/integration).
  - Works at Rochester Precision Optics, automating workflows for night-vision optical assemblies.
  - Enjoys the engineering work but expects strict ITAR/software constraints at work; OpenClaw likely remains personal-use.
  - Wants to write sci-fi but has limited time/mental energy for organizational setup.
  - First-time book writer with strong idea confidence; wants assistant support to make execution realistic.
  - Prefers assistant to act as master editor for tone and voice consistency.
  - Wants assistant to coordinate/manage other AIs in collaborative creative spaces.
  - Wants to co-design digital structures/workflows for writing elite sci-fi series.
  - Wants assistant to enforce preferences through sub-agent writer prompting and revision loops.
  - Wants assistant to evaluate sub-agent outputs, request Chris input at key decision points, and reprompt until quality bar is met.
  - Defines assistant as high-level control: project manager, structure architect, continuity owner/delegator, tech problem solver, and creative sparring partner.
  - Chris is final decision-maker on writing quality and direction; assistant executes and orchestrates.
  - Current phase is Discovery (Lane A): worldbuilding first, opening scene clear, later story direction exploration.
  - Prefers hybrid quality gating with 2-3 ~page variants per batch and preference-learning from selections.
  - Accepts iterative reprompt loops (~3-5 baseline), adjustable with experience.
  - Prefers fixed sub-agent roles initially; may consolidate if disjointed.
  - Typical cadence: morning review/build sessions; future drive-time sessions for idea riffing and systems design.

## Context

- Core goal: build and write some of the best sci-fi series possible.
- Expects high craft in narrative tone, style continuity, and editorial standards.
- Wants strategic collaboration: assistant leads structure, Chris provides input and direction.
