## Purpose

Define minimum doctrine for Asterion League governance so the coalition cannot drift into either:
1. hand-waved stable federal state too early, or
2. emergency-rule mirror of Steward/Consensus authoritarian patterns.

This pack hardens four required layers for scene and policy writing: **authority limits, emergency powers, accountability, failure modes**.

---

## 1) Charter Baseline (What Asterion is and is not)

- Asterion League is a **federated wartime compact**, not a unitary sovereign state.
- Belt Municipal Compacts retain local civil authority by default.
- League-level authority is valid only for enumerated domains:
  1. inter-compact convoy security,
  2. Class 1 non-monopoly custody,
  3. cross-theater evidence integrity,
  4. treaty compliance arbitration.
- Any non-enumerated power claim is presumptively ultra vires unless ratified by compact supermajority plus public docketing.

---

## 2) Authority Limits Doctrine (Anti-Capture Design)

### 2.1 Separation lock
No single coalition can simultaneously control:
- fabrication allocation,
- security command,
- information verification.

### 2.2 Dual-key fabrication lock
Class 1 strategic actions require:
- technical authorization key (Asterion Concord side), and
- civil legitimacy key (rotating municipal caucus side).

### 2.3 Time-scoped mandates
- League task authorities expire automatically (default 2 transfer cycles).
- Renewals require explicit contradiction review: mechanism -> decision -> cost statement.

### 2.4 Jurisdiction ceiling
League security forces cannot replace municipal civil policing except under published emergency warrants with sunset.

---

## 3) Emergency Powers Doctrine (Bounded and Self-Extinguishing)

### 3.1 Trigger classes
Emergency activation limited to:
- life-support cascade threat,
- verified mass-casualty attack chain,
- Class 1 custody compromise with immediate proliferation risk.

### 3.2 Activation test
Must pass all three:
1. Necessity: ordinary legal tools are materially insufficient.
2. Proportionality: least harmful available intervention chosen.
3. Auditability: decision record published within latency-feasible window.

### 3.3 Sunset architecture
- Initial emergency orders auto-expire unless renewed by supermajority + municipal concurrence.
- Post-event review is mandatory and cannot be waived by security classification.

### 3.4 Forbidden emergency shortcuts
- No indefinite emergency continuation by procedural delay.
- No immunity for command-tier actors.
- No link-rights suspension for labor, care, or travel access.

---

## 4) Accountability Doctrine

### 4.1 Liability chain
Every coercive action must bind a named accountable human command path, including remote warform deployments.

### 4.2 Public contradiction docket
Each high-impact decree logs:
- promised public good,
- expected displaced costs,
- measurable rollback trigger.

### 4.3 Oversight braid
Required three-layer review:
1. municipal ombuds nodes,
2. cross-compact evidentiary panel,
3. survivor/victim representation seat with minority-report rights.

### 4.4 Archive integrity
Emergency and fabrication records are evidence objects; destruction or concealment triggers adverse legal inference.

## 5) Failure-Mode Map (Use as mandatory stressors)

1. **Centralization creep:** emergency coordination hardens into permanent executive command.
2. **Legitimacy debt:** procedural correctness without service restoration collapses trust.
3. **Fab patronage capture:** Class 1 access becomes factional reward channel.
4. **Accountability washout:** remote systems used to diffuse human culpability.
5. **Security exceptionalism relapse:** anti-piracy pressure used to justify broad civic-rights rollback.
6. **Fragmentation stall:** veto proliferation blocks urgent but lawful coordination.

For each failure mode, scenes must show mitigation cost, not instant correction.

---

## 6) Intervention Ladder for Asterion Internal Drift

- **L1 Signal:** dissent and doctrine variance visible; publish variance map, no coercive correction.
- **L2 Structured correction:** charter hearing + targeted mandate narrowing.
- **L3 Integrity breach:** suspend affected authorities, trigger external joint audit.
- **L4 Constitutional hazard:** emergency transfer of contested powers to temporary neutral trustees with fixed sunset.

---

## 7) Scene Application Rules

1. If Asterion solves crisis fast, show who pays administrative/fatigue/service cost.
2. Any emergency order must include explicit sunset language or opposition challenge beat.
3. Class 1 aid without dual-key civil signoff is a doctrine violation beat.
4. Accountability must terminate in named humans, never abstract systems.

---

## Contradiction-Check Summary

- Preserves Asterion fragility lock (no instant stable hegemonic state).
- Preserves anti-relapse lock (no mirror-Steward emergency permanence).
- Preserves fabrication ladder lock (Class 1 remains scarce, politically constrained).
- Preserves warform agency/accountability split (human liability remains explicit).
- Introduces no naming drift; canonical actor set unchanged.
