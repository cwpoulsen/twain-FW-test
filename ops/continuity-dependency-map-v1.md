# Continuity Dependency Map v1

Purpose: define which canon pillars must be true for each major Book 1-3 beat to remain coherent.

Cross-refs:
- Holes register: `ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md`
- Contradiction scanner: `ops/contradiction-scanner-checklist-v1.md`
- Canon ledger: `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`
- Patch set: `canon/continuity-patch-wave2-v1.md`

## A) Dependency Backbone (Top-Level)

1. **Governance Control Doctrine** (`canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §§2–4)
   - Required by: coercion motives, marine trap architecture, social legitimacy conflict.
2. **Fabrication Hierarchy + Class 1/2 Monopoly** (`canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §5)
   - Required by: strategic stakes of databank, evidence-war stakes in Books 2–3.
3. **Latency-Limited Cognitive Control** (`canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §7.3)
   - Required by: plausibility of Belt resistance and off-Earth tactical uncertainty.
4. **Marine Contract Trap** (`canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §8)
   - Required by: squad expendability logic and betrayal mechanics.
5. **Master Timeline Sequence Authority** (`timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`)
   - Required by: scene ordering, emotional causality, and reveal timing.

## B) Critical Beat Dependencies

| Story Beat | Must Depend On | Failure If Broken |
|---|---|---|
| B1 Betrayal + Escape | Marine disposal doctrine + command secrecy + comms corridor window | Becomes coincidence escape with no systemic logic |
| B1 Databank Raid Moral Pivot | Post-betrayal free-team operations + misinformation battles + constrained nonlethal doctrine | Loses emotional weight or appears redundant with betrayal beat |
| B2 Alliance Market | Belt autonomy + Earth supply leverage + latency-limited control | Belt politics flatten into generic chase plot |
| B2 Brother Pre-Reveal/Reveal | Long-seeded intervention traces + risk-bearing inside source constraints | Reveal feels unearned and melodramatic |
| B3 Proof War | Shadow ledger integrity + distributed evidence mirrors + anti-scrub tradecraft | “Expose truth” arc collapses under easy denial/scrub |

---

## C) Character Arc Dependency Links

- **Hale arc (protector -> deliberate leader)** depends on strict ordering of betrayal before later moral-injury operations.
- **Valerie arc (rage -> precision)** depends on delayed reveal structure (seed in B1, forced decision in B2).
- **Isaac arc (ghost -> strategist)** depends on early shadow-ledger start and later chain-of-custody pressure.
- **Marko arc** depends on persistent autonomy-threat environment (not one-off panic gimmick).
- **Lin arc** depends on repeated debrief-fracture scenes proving social truth divergence.

## D) Update Protocol for Any New Scene/Bio Change

1. Attach sequence index and UTC/local time marker.
2. Check if edit changes dependency in sections A-C.
3. If yes, update both:
   - `ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md`
   - either `canon/continuity-patch-wave2-v1.md` or `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`
4. Log ripple impacts in `ops/book-bible-progress-log.md`.
