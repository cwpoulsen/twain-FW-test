# Wave 11 Expansion Commit Report

Date: 2026-02-19 (America/New_York)
Scope: Books 5–7 bridge scene-quality expansion with Reality Gate enforcement and dependency-linked consequence hardening.

## Deliverables
1. Added **20 new high-stakes scene packets** for Books 5–7:
   - `series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md`
2. Added mission->scene consequence chain bridge for Books 5–7:
   - `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books5-7-wave11-v1.md`
3. Added timeline sequence support map for Books 5–7 packet ordering:
   - `timeline/books5-7-bridge-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`
4. Updated cross-link map in dependency grid:
   - `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`
5. Captured continuity guard scan evidence:
   - `ops/evidence/wave11-continuity-guard-checks-2026-02-19.txt`

## Word Counts
- `series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md`: **2615** words
- `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books5-7-wave11-v1.md`: **567** words
- `timeline/books5-7-bridge-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`: **476** words
- `ops/evidence/wave11-continuity-guard-checks-2026-02-19.txt`: **7415** words (scan transcript)

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Reality Gate constraints explicitly embedded in packet set and reflected in outcomes.
- No instant-command, instant-reinforcement, or zero-cost logistics claims introduced.
- FVB handling remains canon-aligned (interdiction + recruitment-funnel disruption, not suppression-only).
- Governance beats preserve sunset/audit/appeal pathways and avoid emergency-power handwave.
- Character arcs remain cumulative across Books 5–7 (no reset drift).

## Notes
- New timeline file uses bridge-local sequence IDs (`0310`–`0415`) under master seq `0300` umbrella from `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`.
- New packet set cross-links both timeline and mission-consequence chain docs per strategy controls.
