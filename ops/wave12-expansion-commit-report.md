# Wave 12 Expansion Commit Report

Date: 2026-02-19 (America/New_York)
Scope: Books 8–10 endgame bridge scene expansion with Reality Gate enforcement, dependency-linked consequence hardening, and continuity-guard evidence capture.

## Deliverables
1. Added **24 new high-stakes scene packets** for Books 8–10:
   - `series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md`
2. Added mission->scene consequence chain bridge for Books 8–10:
   - `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books8-10-wave12-v1.md`
3. Added timeline sequence support map for Books 8–10 packet ordering:
   - `timeline/books8-10-endgame-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`
4. Updated dependency-grid cross-link map:
   - `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`
5. Captured continuity guard scan evidence:
   - `ops/evidence/wave12-continuity-guard-checks-2026-02-19.txt`

## Word Counts
- `series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md`: **2869** words
- `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books8-10-wave12-v1.md`: **728** words
- `timeline/books8-10-endgame-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`: **583** words
- `ops/evidence/wave12-continuity-guard-checks-2026-02-19.txt`: **22417** words (scan transcript)

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Reality Gate constraints are embedded in packet lock and carried into scene outcomes.
- No instant command/instant reinforcement/zero-cost logistics claims introduced.
- Book 8 handoff, Book 9 governability, and Book 10 anti-relapse terminal constraints remain explicit and auditable.
- FVB treatment remains canon-aligned dual track (principal interdiction + non-principal reintegration corridors).
- End-state remains imperfect/self-correcting, avoiding clean-victory relapse contradiction.

## Notes
- New timeline file continues bridge sequence numbering (`0420`–`0535`) and preserves cross-book causal continuity from Books 5–7.
- New packet set includes explicit cross-links to timeline + mission consequence docs per strategy controls.
