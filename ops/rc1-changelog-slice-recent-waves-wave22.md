## Net delta for RC1

Across Waves 19–21, changes are primarily:
1. **Stabilization + packaging** (snapshot and authority routing)
2. **Review usability** (summaries, guides, indexed paths)
3. **Operational governance** (monitor pack + GO/NO-GO gate)

This slice indicates RC1 is a governance/readiness consolidation milestone rather than a new canon expansion wave.
