# Post-250k Reconciliation Completion Status (Passes 6-8)

Date: 2026-02-19
Window: Pass 6 (contradiction triage) -> Pass 7 (reality gate + regression) -> Pass 8 (closeout)
Baseline SHA at sweep start: `aab4870f982d18cbdad8ab1490cbb6096cf96722`

## Scope completed
1. Specificity/novelty tightening on high-noise expansion docs.
2. Clarity/compression rewrite of duplicated boilerplate-heavy sections.
3. Regression validation:
   - continuity grep suite A-E,
   - contradiction/domain checklist spot validation,
   - reality-gate contradiction-trigger scans,
   - timeline `reality_gate_pressure` presence check.

## Patches applied
- `canon/outer-system-governance-crisis-framework-v1.md`
  - Replaced repeated template blocks with ring-specific crisis surfaces and unique scene hooks.
- `series/post-reconquest-governance-and-restoration-expansion-v1.md`
  - Rebuilt into concise phased implementation framework with explicit anti-relapse controls and expansion guardrails.
- `ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md`
  - Added Pass 6-8 closure entries (`W15-001`, `W15-002`) and risk-state refresh.

## Regression result
- **P0/P1 lock failures:** none unresolved.
- A1/B1/C1/D1 residual hits classify as policy/checklist/register context, not active narrative violations.
- E2 deprecated fabrication taxonomy drift: zero hits.
- Reality-gate trigger scan: no contradiction assertions; only guardrail/rule references.
- Timeline bridge maps retain required `reality_gate_pressure` field.

## Evidence
- `ops/evidence/post250k-reconciliation-2026-02-19-pass6-8.txt`

## Remaining open risks (explicit)
1. **R-005 (P2):** scene packet template standardization (transit/comms/governor required fields).
2. **R-006 (P2):** Asterion League governance charter constraints need formalization depth.
3. **R-007 (P2):** AI-seed safety doctrine (containment/testing/escalation ladder) still open.
4. **R-008 (P2):** FVB sub-faction differentiation depth monitor.

## Status
**Passes 6-8 complete for current scope.**
No unresolved P0/P1 blockers remain; reconciliation carries forward with documented P2 risk backlog.
