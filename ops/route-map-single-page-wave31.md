## Safe pointers
- Keep these four primaries as the only entry points for new review passes.
- Treat Wave 17 packs/manifests as legacy-route material (annotated for future archive move; no moves in this map).
- For any new guide, keep metadata discipline (`Companion to:` and explicit route-role note) before merge.
