# Timeline Policy v1 (Hard Sci-Fi)

We use **in-world real dates and times** as authoritative chronology.

## Rules
1. Every event must include `world_datetime_start`.
2. Events that span time should include `world_datetime_end`.
3. Every event must have a unique `sequence_index` for total ordering.
4. No hand-wavy temporal jumps without explicit travel/comms math.
5. If chronology conflicts with narrative intent, chronology wins unless retcon is approved.

## Time Math Discipline
- Track travel durations explicitly.
- Track communication latency where relevant.
- Track operational windows (fuel, life support, orbital windows, etc.).

## Validation Habit
Before locking chapters:
- Verify scene timestamps align with event chronology.
- Verify character location feasibility by elapsed time.
- Verify tech operations obey known constraints.


## Quantitative Reference
- Travel math authority: `tech/fusion-transit-assumptions-and-lane-calculus-v1.md`
- Timeline locks must cite lane distance, accel envelope, and comm delay when operationally relevant.
