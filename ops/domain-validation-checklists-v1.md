# Per-Domain Continuity Validation Checklists v1

Use with `ops/contradiction-scanner-checklist-v1.md` for fast acceptance gates.

## Canon (`canon/*`)
- [ ] New claims tagged CORE/SOFT/RUMOR and do not silently override CORE.
- [ ] Lock bundle preserved: AI timing, Asterion naming, pursuit uncertainty, warform agency, low-g realism.
- [ ] Any retcon includes impact list + cross-links.

## Timeline (`timeline/*`)
- [ ] Sequence order preserves locked causality (AI acquisition precedes databank training event).
- [ ] Travel/comms windows still physically plausible per transit assumptions.
- [ ] Long-arc (Books 1–10) dependencies remain monotonic and cross-linked.

## Series (`series/*`)
- [ ] Series lens reflects post-EDF free-operator reality, not EDF-present default.
- [ ] Constraints include no-omniscience pursuit and low-g/no-magic operations.
- [ ] Arc scaffolds do not collapse Asterion political fragility into instant stable governance.

## Factions (`factions/*`)
- [ ] Uses **Asterion League** consistently for anti-Consensus coalition identity.
- [ ] FVB destabilizer ecology represented as plural actor set, not single villain mass.
- [ ] Command doctrine keeps capability limits tied to logistics/maintenance reality.

## Tech (`tech/*`)
- [ ] Fabrication class ladder unchanged (3/4 -> Blackfly 2 -> Asterion 1).
- [ ] Transit equations/assumptions not contradicted by prose claims.
- [ ] Any tactical claim states implied resource/maintenance costs.

## Characters (`characters/*`)
- [ ] Behavior updates persist after turning-point events (no reset drift).
- [ ] Knowledge boundaries obey latency and incomplete intel constraints.
- [ ] Relationship changes tied to events/timeline IDs where possible.

## Scenes (`scenes/*`)
- [ ] Action choreography respects anchoring/attitude control/recoil on small bodies.
- [ ] Evidence and custody beats include source/time/path notes.
- [ ] No scene implies omniscient antagonist control unless explicitly bounded and explained.

## Ops (`ops/*`)
- [ ] Cross-references point to current authority docs (no stale register names).
- [ ] New wave reports include grep evidence + contradiction summary.
- [ ] Any unresolved issue logged in holes register with severity + owner.
