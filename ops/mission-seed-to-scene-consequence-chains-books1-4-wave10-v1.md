# Stewards of Progress — Mission Seed -> Scene Packet Consequence Chains (Books 1-4) Wave 10 v1

Status: Consequence-bridge pass (mission seeds to scene packets) with explicit immediate/delayed/cross-book chains.

Canon locks and authority anchors (unchanged):
- `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`
- `canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md`
- `series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md`
- `ops/books1-4-mission-scenario-bank-v1.md`
- `timeline/books1-4-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`
- `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`
- `ops/continuity-dependency-map-v1.md`
- `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md`

Method:
- Bridge each selected mission seed to its packet.
- Force consequence visibility across six domains: **character, faction, logistics, legitimacy, intel, civilian morale**.
- Track across three horizons: **immediate**, **delayed (same-book to next-book)**, **cross-book (structural)**.
