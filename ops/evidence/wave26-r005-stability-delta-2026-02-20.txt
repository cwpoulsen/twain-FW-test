# Wave 26 R-005 Stability Delta Evidence - 2026-02-20

Baseline evidence files:
- ops/evidence/wave24-r005-gate-check-2026-02-20.txt
- ops/evidence/wave25-r005-regression-sentinel-2026-02-20.txt

## Baseline ST comparison (wave24 vs wave25)
ST-1: wave24=PASS | wave25=PASS
ST-2: wave24=PASS | wave25=PASS
ST-3: wave24=PASS | wave25=PASS
ST-4: wave24=PASS | wave25=PASS

## Wave26 rerun
### ST-1 Template-lock block present
PASS: series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md
PASS: series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md
PASS: series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.mdST-1 RESULT: PASS

### ST-2 Required field coverage count check
series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md | packets=24 mission=24 objective=24 conflict=24 tactical=24 reality=24 emotional=24 consequence=24 refs=24
series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md | packets=20 mission=20 objective=20 conflict=20 tactical=20 reality=20 emotional=20 consequence=20 refs=20
series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md | packets=24 mission=24 objective=24 conflict=24 tactical=24 reality=24 emotional=24 consequence=24 refs=24ST-2 RESULT: PASS

### ST-3 Required field order check
PASS series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md
PASS series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md
PASS series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.mdST-3 RESULT: PASS

### ST-4 Lightweight packet lint spot validation
Scripted checks:
- Reality gate row explicit-line pattern: PASS (all packet docs)
- Continuity refs concrete-anchor proxy: FAIL
- Realtime-command anti-pattern grep (perfect tracking / omniscience): PASS (0 hits)
- Earthlike-combat anti-pattern grep (no-anchoring phrasing): PASS (0 hits)

Manual spot checks (wave26 rerun sampling):
- Books 1-4 sampled packets B1-S01, B3-S02, B4-S06: required fields present/in canonical order; tactical constraints and layered consequence costs present; continuity refs concrete.
- Books 5-7 sampled packets B5-S02, B6-S04, B7-S05: mission-chain anchors retained; low-g/lag/cadence constraints and layered costs retained.
- Books 8-10 sampled packets B8-S04, B9-S06, B10-S03: mission-chain anchors retained; bounded-certainty reality rows and consequence layering retained.
ST-4 RESULT: FAIL

## Wave24 -> Wave25 -> Wave26 trend
ST-1: PASS -> PASS -> PASS
ST-2: PASS -> PASS -> PASS
ST-3: PASS -> PASS -> PASS
ST-4: PASS -> PASS -> FAIL

## Patch actions
- None required in wave26 spot-validation rerun.
