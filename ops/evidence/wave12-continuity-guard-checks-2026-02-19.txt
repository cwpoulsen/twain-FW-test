ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:22:The anti-Consensus Belt coalition is locked as the **Asterion League**. This is not purely naming hygiene; it implies that anti-Consensus governance has enough persistent structure to issue standards, convene tribunals, negotiate convoy immunity corridors, and run verification pipelines. Ad hoc rebel clusters cannot reliably do these things at inter-lane scale. Therefore, this document treats the Asterion League as a layered institutional mesh: councils, enforcement bureaus, arbitration nodes, and emergency logistics cells.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:24:Fabrication hierarchy is locked: legacy classes remain baseline, Blackfly has constrained Class 2 capacity, Asterion League fields fragile Class 1 capability. “Fragile” is treated as both technical and political fragility. A Class 1 stack can fail by heat, sabotage, software poisoning, talent loss, or legitimacy collapse. Legal and security frameworks therefore revolve around preserving *continuity of operation* more than preserving any single machine.

ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:42:The Asterion League exists because anti-Consensus actors need durable coordination under distance, delay, and attrition. Informal trust rings can hide; they cannot reliably allocate oxygen rights, deconflict convoy lanes, settle salvage claims, or maintain anti-corruption registries. As soon as the coalition controls any recurring public good—medication lots, heat-exchanger ceramic stock, comms relay access—it must institutionalize.

The baseline cycle has five packet states: draft, local adoption, dispute hold, provisional ratification, and archive lock. Draft packets include model policy text, implementation burden estimates, and expected contradiction interfaces with current compact law. Local adoption records must include explicit variance notes if a habitat adopts only parts of the packet due to life-support constraints, labor shortages, or unresolved legal conflicts. Dispute hold can be triggered by any two non-aligned nodes that cite concrete contradiction, feasibility, or legitimacy deficits.
