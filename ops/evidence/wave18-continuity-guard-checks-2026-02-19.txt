canon/ops/faction-naming-policy.md:14:- **Belters** / **the Belters** as a generic stand-in for the faction
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:60:Scope executed: repo-wide grep scan for pre-lock residue categories: old EDF-present framing, wrong AI acquisition timing, generic Belters usage, omniscient tracking assumptions, missing low-g physics anchors.
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:66:- **W8-002 (Closed):** Legacy naming residue (`Solar Defense Force`) in discovery reservoir.
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:102:- `series/worldbuilding-core-pack-v1.md:67` -> `Solar Defense Force` naming residue.
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:105:- `canon/ops/faction-naming-policy.md:14` -> only sanctioned mention of forbidden generic `Belters` label (policy context).
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:109:- **Generic Belters usage:** no active narrator-canon misuse found outside policy/archival mention.
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:164:- Deprecated naming (`Belters`, `Solar Defense Force`) not found in active Wave 10/11 scoped content.

## A2
canon/outer-system-governance-crisis-framework-v1.md:5:This framework defines how governance crises propagate after the opening AI-seed extraction, the later databank training/provenance split, and the locked fabrication ladder (Class 4/3 -> Blackfly Class 2 -> Asterion League fragile Class 1). It is a decision-pressure map for Books 2-10: mechanism creates a constraint, leadership chooses, and the bill arrives later as legitimacy, logistics, or security debt.
canon/outer-system-governance-crisis-framework-v1.md:64:- Uses **Asterion League** naming consistently.
canon/outer-system-governance-crisis-framework-v1.md:65:- Preserves Blackfly as constrained **Class 2** and Asterion League as fragile **Class 1**.
canon/reconquest-civil-administration-and-legitimacy-doctrine-wave18-v1.md:8:- Canonical actors only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.
canon/canon-ledger-v2.md:9:- Use canonical actor names only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.
canon/canon-ledger-v2.md:66:- **CORE:** A Belt anti-Consensus coalition named the **Asterion League** has successfully created/fielded a Class 1 fabricator capability.
canon/canon-ledger-v2.md:67:- **SOFT:** Full topology and replication depth of Asterion League Class 1 remains compartmented.
canon/canon-ledger-v2.md:83:- **CORE:** The **Asterion League** provides anti-Consensus Belt actors with an institutional alternative to ad hoc resistance.
canon/canon-ledger-v2.md:108:11. The Asterion League’s Class 1 breakthrough shatters monopoly certainty and starts multi-book sovereignty realignment.  
canon/canon-ledger-v2.md:142:- **SOFT (updated Wave 17):** Asterion League governance remains federated/provisional but now constrained by explicit charter doctrine (`ops/asterion-governance-charter-doctrine-pack-v1.md`): enumerated powers, emergency sunsets, dual-key Class 1 controls, and liability-chain accountability.
canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md:13:- Asterion League naming and strategic role are preserved.
canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md:120:- Asterion League creates external benchmark proving SFAB scarcity claims are partly manufactured.
canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md:189:BMAX is the Belt’s survival mesh and soft-power engine. Initially local and improvised, it becomes the social substrate the Asterion League can build legitimacy on.
canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md:209:## I-08. Asterion League Provisional Coordinating Assembly (AL-PCA)
canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md:307:5. Keep Asterion League institutional design plural and provisional until late arc convergence.
canon/coalition-diplomacy-failure-casebook-wave11-v1.md:253:- Asterion League naming preserved; no deprecated coalition labels used in narrator voice.
canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md:17:- Use canonical actor names only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.
canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md:36:**Rule:** Belt anti-Consensus coalition is named **Asterion League** and has created/fielded a Class 1 fabricator capability.
canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md:41:- Deprecated generic labels are disallowed as narrator faction names; use **Asterion League** per naming policy.
canon/coalition-wartime-institutions-bible-v1.md:36:### Institutional Interoperability with Asterion League
canon/ops/faction-naming-policy.md:4:- **Asterion League**
canon/ops/faction-naming-policy.md:6:Use **Asterion League** as the default reference in canon prose, metadata, timelines, faction docs, and continuity notes.
canon/ops/faction-naming-policy.md:23:1. Replace generic faction stand-ins with **Asterion League**.
factions/factions-doctrine-ledger-v1.md:8:- Use canonical actor names only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.
factions/factions-doctrine-ledger-v1.md:102:## 5) Asterion League (Asterion Concord technical wing-led) (Political-Military Resistance Spectrum)

factions/sanction-bypass-industrial-networks-dossier-wave11-v1.md:225:- Asterion League treated as politically fragile operator of scarce Class 1 capability.
factions/black-market-logistics-economics-dossier-v1.md:15:Fabrication politics are upstream: feedstock purity, calibration authenticity, firmware custody. Canon lock preserved: Blackfly has constrained Class 2 leverage; Asterion League fields fragile Class 1 capacity.
factions/reintegration-actors-and-governance-friction-dossier-wave18-v1.md:8:- Canonical actors only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.

series/post-reconquest-governance-and-restoration-expansion-v1.md:107:- Asterion League naming preserved.
series/wave11-integration-diplomacy-sanctions-governance-adjudication-v1.md:9:For continuity safety, each module binds to fixed locks. Blackfly remains a post-EDF free-operator crew with constrained Class 2 leverage and uncertain location traceability under nuke masking history. Asterion League appears as a fragile but real Class 1-bearing coalition rather than a consolidated state. Consensus power is strong in institutions but weak at latency edges where command loops desynchronize and local improvisation dominates.
series/postwar-justice-failure-arcs-and-repair-framework-wave18-v1.md:8:- Canonical actors only: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, **Asterion League**.

series/coalition-fracture-repair-arc-atlas-v1.md:4:This atlas turns strategic continuity locks into repeatable narrative engines. Every phase assumes Blackfly remains a post-EDF free operator team with constrained Class 2 leverage; Asterion League remains politically fragile despite Class 1 breakthrough; and outer-system command loops remain latency-bound.
series/coalition-fracture-repair-arc-atlas-v1.md:10:- Beat 1: Task force negotiates corridor access; FVB brokers test convoy defenses with deniable raids; municipal councils debate whether emergency powers should sunset now or after one additional transfer cycle.

ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md:271:6. Are Asterion League and Earth institutions both shown as politically mixed rather than pure?
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:22:The anti-Consensus Belt coalition is locked as the **Asterion League**. This is not purely naming hygiene; it implies that anti-Consensus governance has enough persistent structure to issue standards, convene tribunals, negotiate convoy immunity corridors, and run verification pipelines. Ad hoc rebel clusters cannot reliably do these things at inter-lane scale. Therefore, this document treats the Asterion League as a layered institutional mesh: councils, enforcement bureaus, arbitration nodes, and emergency logistics cells.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:24:Fabrication hierarchy is locked: legacy classes remain baseline, Blackfly has constrained Class 2 capacity, Asterion League fields fragile Class 1 capability. “Fragile” is treated as both technical and political fragility. A Class 1 stack can fail by heat, sabotage, software poisoning, talent loss, or legitimacy collapse. Legal and security frameworks therefore revolve around preserving *continuity of operation* more than preserving any single machine.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:38:## 1) Coalition Institution Operations: How the Asterion League Actually Governs Under Latency
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:42:The Asterion League exists because anti-Consensus actors need durable coordination under distance, delay, and attrition. Informal trust rings can hide; they cannot reliably allocate oxygen rights, deconflict convoy lanes, settle salvage claims, or maintain anti-corruption registries. As soon as the coalition controls any recurring public good—medication lots, heat-exchanger ceramic stock, comms relay access—it must institutionalize.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:173:**Section-end authority refs:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` (Asterion League identity, post-EDF crew status, warform lock); `tech/fusion-transit-assumptions-and-lane-calculus-v1.md` (latency and route constraints); `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md` (fatigue/logistics realism); `ops/strategy-control-log.md` (cross-link and contradiction-check method).
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:711:- **Asterion League naming lock:** maintained across all sections.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:750:Asterion League secretariat sessions run on a staggered cycle because synchronized plenaries are unrealistic across broad geometry spreads. The baseline cycle has five packet states: draft, local adoption, dispute hold, provisional ratification, and archive lock. Draft packets include model policy text, implementation burden estimates, and expected contradiction interfaces with current compact law. Local adoption records must include explicit variance notes if a habitat adopts only parts of the packet due to life-support constraints, labor shortages, or unresolved legal conflicts. Dispute hold can be triggered by any two non-aligned nodes that cite concrete contradiction, feasibility, or legitimacy deficits.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:1480:Use “Asterion League” consistently for anti-Consensus coalition identity. Use “non-conscious remote warform” for locked warform category. Use “post-EDF free operators” for core crew status. Use “seed custody versus training rights” distinction for AI-related disputes.

ops/coalition-institutions-economic-warfare-civilian-logistics-law-wave8-v1.md:680:**Check:** Material avoids implying ubiquitous Class 1 or unlimited Blackfly output. Class 2 leverage is strategic but constrained by feedstock, labor, and logistics. Asterion Class 1 remains non-trivial and non-magical.

ops/wave13-post-conflict-stabilization-consensus-remnant-and-belt-earth-reintegration-v1.md:11:This expansion obeys the locked actor naming standard: **Steward Directorate**, **Consensus Operations Complex**, **Earth Defense Fleet (EDF)**, **Belt Municipal Compacts**, and **Asterion League**. It assumes Blackfly remains a free-operator unit, post-EDF, and is not returned to EDF chain of command. It treats Asterion League Class 1 capability as real but politically and technically fragile, and Blackfly Class 2 capability as strategically significant but constrained by staffing, feedstock, thermal, and verification limits. It preserves the AI-seed-first / databank-training-later split and prohibits deus-ex network omniscience.
ops/wave13-post-conflict-stabilization-consensus-remnant-and-belt-earth-reintegration-v1.md:1046:- Asterion Class 1 treated as fragile and bounded; Blackfly Class 2 treated as constrained, not miracle throughput.
