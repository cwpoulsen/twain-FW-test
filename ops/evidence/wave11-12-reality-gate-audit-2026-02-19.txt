# Wave 11–12 Reality Gate Audit Evidence
Date: 2026-02-19 (America/New_York)
Scope: Wave 11–12 bridge docs for low-g behavior, comm latency, logistics realism, fatigue realism.

## Authority Anchors
- ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md
- series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md
- series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md
- ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books5-7-wave11-v1.md
- ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books8-10-wave12-v1.md

## Pre-patch observation
Violation class W12-001 (P1 abstraction drift):
- Timeline sequence maps encoded dependency gates, but did not include per-row reality-gate pressure annotations.
- This created a handoff risk where downstream scene drafting could skip one or more hard constraints (low-g, comm latency, logistics, fatigue) at sequence level.

## Patch Evidence (post-fix)
1) timeline/books5-7-bridge-operational-sequence-map-v1.md
- Added reality gate pressure column: line 11
- Explicit low-g behavior references: lines 14, 21, 27
- Explicit comm latency references: lines 16, 22, 24, 28, 29
- Explicit logistics references: lines 15, 19, 20, 25, 30
- Explicit fatigue references: lines 16, 18, 23, 31, 32

2) timeline/books8-10-endgame-operational-sequence-map-v1.md
- Added reality gate pressure column: line 12
- Explicit low-g behavior references: lines 16, 22
- Explicit comm latency references: lines 14, 15, 19, 26, 33, 35
- Explicit logistics references: lines 18, 23, 25, 27, 29, 34
- Explicit fatigue references: lines 17, 20, 21, 24, 31, 36

## Cross-check references showing existing packet-level compliance (no patch required)
- series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md:17-19, 39, 47, 99, 107, 115, 175, 183
- series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md:17-19, 63, 115, 131, 207, 223
- ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books5-7-wave11-v1.md:48-50
- ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books8-10-wave12-v1.md:52-54

## Result
- W12-001 closed.
- No remaining P0/P1 reality-gate contradiction in audited Wave 11–12 scope.
