canon/outer-system-governance-crisis-framework-v1.md:5:This document expands the governance crisis mechanics after the Blackfly opening AI acquisition, the later databank-training split, and the Class 4/3/2/1 fabrication order where Blackfly is constrained Class 2 and Asterion League is fragile Class 1. It focuses on mechanism -> decision -> cost, so that strategic drama is not reduced to slogans.
canon/outer-system-governance-crisis-framework-v1.md:14:Cost propagation: each decree that ignores lane friction increases black-market dependence. Each local exception that bypasses treaty wording weakens coalition trust. Asterion League institutions can absorb some variance because fragile Class 1 capacity creates bargaining leverage, but they cannot absorb unlimited legitimacy loss. Blackfly's constrained Class 2 stack stabilizes specific nodes, not the whole ring. That bounded capability must remain explicit in scene planning.
canon/outer-system-governance-crisis-framework-v1.md:44:- Pass: Uses Asterion League naming and preserves Blackfly post-EDF free-operator status.

series/post-reconquest-governance-and-restoration-expansion-v1.md:14:Mechanism: procurement shifts from closed security queues to transparent lot registries with chain-of-custody signatures mirrored across Belt Municipal Compacts. Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: constitutional bargaining consumes scarce administrative talent that could otherwise accelerate infrastructure repair.

ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md:271:6. Are Asterion League and Earth institutions both shown as politically mixed rather than pure?
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:22:The anti-Consensus Belt coalition is locked as the **Asterion League**. This is not purely naming hygiene; it implies that anti-Consensus governance has enough persistent structure to issue standards, convene tribunals, negotiate convoy immunity corridors, and run verification pipelines. Ad hoc rebel clusters cannot reliably do these things at inter-lane scale. Therefore, this document treats the Asterion League as a layered institutional mesh: councils, enforcement bureaus, arbitration nodes, and emergency logistics cells.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:24:Fabrication hierarchy is locked: legacy classes remain baseline, Blackfly has constrained Class 2 capacity, Asterion League fields fragile Class 1 capability. “Fragile” is treated as both technical and political fragility. A Class 1 stack can fail by heat, sabotage, software poisoning, talent loss, or legitimacy collapse. Legal and security frameworks therefore revolve around preserving *continuity of operation* more than preserving any single machine.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:38:## 1) Coalition Institution Operations: How the Asterion League Actually Governs Under Latency
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:42:The Asterion League exists because anti-Consensus actors need durable coordination under distance, delay, and attrition. Informal trust rings can hide; they cannot reliably allocate oxygen rights, deconflict convoy lanes, settle salvage claims, or maintain anti-corruption registries. As soon as the coalition controls any recurring public good—medication lots, heat-exchanger ceramic stock, comms relay access—it must institutionalize.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:173:**Section-end authority refs:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` (Asterion League identity, post-EDF crew status, warform lock); `tech/fusion-transit-assumptions-and-lane-calculus-v1.md` (latency and route constraints); `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md` (fatigue/logistics realism); `ops/strategy-control-log.md` (cross-link and contradiction-check method).

ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:750:Asterion League secretariat sessions run on a staggered cycle because synchronized plenaries are unrealistic across broad geometry spreads. The baseline cycle has five packet states: draft, local adoption, dispute hold, provisional ratification, and archive lock. Draft packets include model policy text, implementation burden estimates, and expected contradiction interfaces with current compact law. Local adoption records must include explicit variance notes if a habitat adopts only parts of the packet due to life-support constraints, labor shortages, or unresolved legal conflicts. Dispute hold can be triggered by any two non-aligned nodes that cite concrete contradiction, feasibility, or legitimacy deficits.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:1480:Use “Asterion League” consistently for anti-Consensus coalition identity. Use “non-conscious remote warform” for locked warform category. Use “post-EDF free operators” for core crew status. Use “seed custody versus training rights” distinction for AI-related disputes. Avoid terms implying unified Belt government unless context explicitly supports multi-node coalition behavior.

Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Bottleneck mapping distinguishes power scarcity from technician scarcity from transport geometry, preventing blanket policy errors. Scrap reclamation brigades are paired with materials laboratories to certify reuse quality and prevent catastrophic counterfeit substitution. Class 2 throughput is allocated by marginal harm reduction per kilogram rather than political prestige, with medical cold-chain parts consistently ranking first.

Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: industrial output remains below pre-collapse baselines for multiple transfer seasons because maintenance debt cannot be legislated away. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Youth service pathways fund repair apprenticeships that convert war-era logistics skills into civil credentials. Legitimacy repair begins with predictable small wins: water reliability, clinic uptime, and honest queue estimates.

Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: communities with severe trauma reject nuanced messaging and demand immediate punitive maximalism. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Media plurality funds are distributed by audience-need indicators, not loyalty tests, reducing propaganda recapture risk. Religious and civic institutions receive compact grants conditioned on non-exclusion and transparent account books. Public memory law protects access to redacted archives after fixed intervals, preventing eternal emergency secrecy.

series/post-reconquest-governance-and-restoration-expansion-v1.md:540:Mechanism: the Consensus Operations Complex is dismantled into bounded analytic utilities with no authority to execute orders, only to publish model advice and error bars. Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: trained operators burn out under dual burdens of repair labor and tribunal testimony. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Demobilization stipends are paid in staged tranches linked to verified civilian employment, reducing relapse incentives. Transit chokepoint policing is co-governed by Earth and Belt panels with emergency sunset clauses. Governor-module evidence packets are admissible across jurisdictions through shared hash registries.

Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: reconstruction budgets absorb high verification overhead because every critical claim needs independent replication. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Civil service exams reward practical troubleshooting and ethics casework alongside technical knowledge. Escort routing algorithms are audited for corridor bias that might abandon low-income ports.

Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: convoy insurance spikes as Freed Voider Bands probe new patrol doctrines and test escort reaction times. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Narrative commissions are structured as evidentiary projects rather than myth-making organs, with minority reports preserved in full. Interoperability standards are frozen for twelve-quarter windows to reduce churn in spare-part ecosystems. Industrial restoration sequencing starts with pump seals, bearings, coolant lines, and sensor calibration before any symbolic megaproject announcements.

series/post-reconquest-governance-and-restoration-expansion-v1.md:1118:Mechanism: the Steward Directorate command lattice is disassembled into auditable civil boards with delayed emergency powers, so no single optimization node can quietly absorb all discretionary authority. Decision: the Asterion League receives constitutional standing as a co-guarantor of fabrication non-monopoly provisions. Cost: factional media frames transparency as confession, amplifying fear that institutions are permanently fragile. Class 1 and Class 2 fabrication capacities are strategic commons under constrained stewardship, not permanent instruments of single-faction domination. Failure-mode drills include capture-by-optimization scenarios where legal forms persist but accountability evaporates. Municipal ombuds nodes publish monthly denial maps showing where services are unequally delivered and why. Succession rules prevent any single coalition from controlling fabrication, security, and information ministries simultaneously. Transitional planners repeatedly discover that sequence discipline matters more than slogan discipline: if legal repair outruns service repair, public trust decays; if service repair outruns accountability, capture returns through procurement and emergency doctrine.

ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:24:Fabrication hierarchy is locked: legacy classes remain baseline, Blackfly has constrained Class 2 capacity, Asterion League fields fragile Class 1 capability. “Fragile” is treated as both technical and political fragility. A Class 1 stack can fail by heat, sabotage, software poisoning, talent loss, or legitimacy collapse. Legal and security frameworks therefore revolve around preserving *continuity of operation* more than preserving any single machine.
ops/coalition-institutions-economic-war-civil-adaptation-frontier-law-v1.md:143:Blackfly’s constrained Class 2 capability makes them too valuable to ignore and too independent to fully control. League institutions therefore use a **structured exceptionalism model**:
