## ST-4 Lightweight packet lint checks (scripted + spot check)
Checklist source: ops/packet-doc-lint-checklist-v1.md

Scripted checks:
- Reality gate row explicit-line pattern: PASS (series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md)
- Reality gate row explicit-line pattern: PASS (series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md)
- Reality gate row explicit-line pattern: PASS (series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md)
- Continuity refs concrete-anchor proxy: PASS (series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md)
- Continuity refs concrete-anchor proxy: PASS (series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md)
- Continuity refs concrete-anchor proxy: PASS (series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md)
- Realtime-command anti-pattern grep (perfect tracking / omniscience): PASS (0 hits)
- Earthlike-combat anti-pattern grep (no-anchoring phrasing): PASS (0 hits)

Manual spot checks (regression sentinel sampling):
- Books 1-4 sampled packets B1-S01, B2-S04, B4-S05: required fields present/in canonical order; tactical constraints + layered consequence + concrete refs retained.
- Books 5-7 sampled packets B5-S03, B6-S02, B7-S06: mission-chain anchor retained, low-g/lag constraints and consequence layering retained.
- Books 8-10 sampled packets B8-S03, B9-S04, B10-S07: mission-chain anchor retained, bounded-certainty/reality rows and consequence layering retained.
ST-4 RESULT: PASS

## Comparison vs prior evidence (ops/evidence/wave24-r005-gate-check-2026-02-20.txt)
- ST-1..ST-4 prior status: PASS/PASS/PASS/PASS
- ST-1..ST-4 current status: PASS/PASS/PASS/PASS
- Coverage counts unchanged from wave24 baseline (24/20/24 packet sets with matching required-field counts).
- No new regressions detected.

## Patch actions
- No patches required; compliance remains intact.
