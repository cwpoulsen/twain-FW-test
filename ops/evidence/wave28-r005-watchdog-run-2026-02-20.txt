## ST-4 Lightweight packet lint (scripted + spot validation)
Scripted checks:
- Reality gate row explicit-line pattern: PASS (series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md)
- Reality gate row explicit-line pattern: PASS (series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md)
- Reality gate row explicit-line pattern: PASS (series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md)
- Continuity refs concrete-anchor proxy: PASS (series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md)
- Continuity refs concrete-anchor proxy: PASS (series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md)
- Continuity refs concrete-anchor proxy: PASS (series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md)
- Realtime-command anti-pattern grep (perfect tracking / omniscience): PASS (0 hits)
- Earthlike-combat anti-pattern grep (no-anchoring phrasing): FAIL
series/reconquest-institutional-integration-matrix-v1.md:231:8. If small-body scenes imply normal walking without stabilization, patch with anchoring and attitude-control mechanics.

Manual spot checks (latest-entry-first sampling):
- Books 1-4 sampled packets B1-S01, B3-S02, B4-S06: required fields present/in canonical order; tactical constraints, explicit reality rows, layered consequence costs, and concrete continuity refs present.
- Books 5-7 sampled packets B5-S02, B6-S04, B7-S05: mission-chain anchors retained; low-g/lag/cadence constraints and layered costs retained.
- Books 8-10 sampled packets B8-S04, B9-S06, B10-S03: mission-chain anchors retained; bounded-certainty reality rows and consequence layering retained.
ST-4 RESULT: FAIL

## Wave28 snapshot
ST-1: PASS
ST-2: PASS
ST-3: PASS
ST-4: FAIL
Patch actions: none required (no clear compliance misses).
