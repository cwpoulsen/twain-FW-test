ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:50:Scope executed: repo-wide grep scan for pre-lock residue categories: old EDF-present framing, wrong AI acquisition timing, generic Belters usage, omniscient tracking assumptions, missing low-g physics anchors.
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:56:- **W8-002 (Closed):** Legacy naming residue (`Solar Defense Force`) in discovery reservoir.
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:92:- `series/worldbuilding-core-pack-v1.md:67` -> `Solar Defense Force` naming residue.
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:95:- `canon/ops/faction-naming-policy.md:14` -> only sanctioned mention of forbidden generic `Belters` label (policy context).
ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md:99:- **Generic Belters usage:** no active narrator-canon misuse found outside policy/archival mention.
