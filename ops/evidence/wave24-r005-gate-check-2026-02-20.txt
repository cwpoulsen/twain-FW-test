## ST-4 Lightweight packet lint checklist (manual + scripted)
Checklist source: ops/packet-doc-lint-checklist-v1.md

Scripted checks:
- Reality gate row explicit-line pattern: PASS (all packet docs)
- Continuity refs concrete-anchor proxy: PASS (all packet docs)
- Realtime-command anti-pattern grep (perfect tracking / omniscience): PASS (0 hits)
- Earthlike-combat anti-pattern grep (no-anchoring phrasing): PASS (0 hits)

Manual spot checks (latest-entry-first run):
- Books 1-4 sampled packets B1-S01, B2-S04, B4-S05: tactical geometry includes concrete operational constraints; consequence ledgers include Immediate + Delayed + broader cost; continuity refs are concrete.
- Books 5-7 sampled packets B5-S03, B6-S02, B7-S06: tactical geometry includes low-g/lag/cadence constraints; consequence layering and refs present.
- Books 8-10 sampled packets B8-S03, B9-S04, B10-S07: tactical geometry includes confidence/fuel/radiator/lag constraints; consequence layering and refs present.

ST-4 RESULT: PASS

## Gate Summary
