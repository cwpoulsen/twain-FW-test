## Appendix A — Marine Contract Enforcement Lifecycle

### A.1 Intake and Eligibility Funnel
1. Candidate appears in exclusion-prone populations (unlinked, debt-encumbered, mobility-restricted).
2. Civic records automatically flag “service opportunity routing.”
3. Recruit receives binary framing: contract path or compounding exclusion penalties.

**Operational note:** coercion is implemented through narrowing alternatives, not overt state confession.

### A.2 Contract Execution Stack
- **Layer 1: Civil pledge** (public language: duty, mobility restoration, family support).
- **Layer 2: Security rider** (classified annex enabling governor-module control bounds).
- **Layer 3: Benefit lock** (remittance and post-service status conditional on compliance score).

### A.3 Enforcement Gradient
- Stage E0: counseling and compliance nudges.
- Stage E1: privilege restriction (leave, med access priority, communications).
- Stage E2: automated command narrowing by governor module.
- Stage E3: breach designation and retrieval directive.
- Stage E4: lethal enforcement authorization (legally masked as mission integrity necessity).

### A.4 Evidentiary Trail Requirements (for plausible legality)
- Signed consent artifact, even if consent quality is dubious.
- System logs proving warnings were issued.
- Medical certs affirming operability.
- Command justification memo tying action to mission risk.

### A.5 Litigation Vulnerabilities
- Consent artifacts created under economic duress.
- Logs showing penalties issued before alleged breach.
- Mismatch between human commander records and module telemetry.
- Statistical disproportionality affecting specific demographic clusters.

## Appendix B — Governor-Module Rules of Engagement (ROE-L)

### B.1 Core Principle
Governor modules are not full autopilot agents; they are bounded obedience and inhibition systems that constrain choice architecture.

### B.2 Legal Framing Language
- “Safety assurance layer” for public channels.
- “Cognitive reliability instrumentation” for procurement channels.
- “Behavioral containment fallback” for classified directives.

### B.3 Action Class Map (linked to autonomy bands)
- **Class Green:** normal tactical initiative.
- **Class Amber:** initiative allowed only within route and target fences.
- **Class Red:** hard overrides active; user agency sharply narrowed.

### B.4 Escalation Triggers
- Comms loss beyond doctrinal tolerance.
- Proximity to forbidden hardware/sensitive archives.
- Command confidence collapse due to conflicting orders.
- Biometric anomaly interpreted as compromise risk.

### B.5 Abuse Scenarios to Track in Narrative
- False-positive escalation due to spoofed telemetry.
- Commander exploiting amber/red transitions for deniable coercion.
- Module drift under latency producing contradictory behavior.
- Black-market interventions that restore agency at severe physiological cost.

## Appendix C — Interplanetary Arrest and Rendition Protocol

### C.1 Jurisdiction Layers
1. Origin jurisdiction (launch authority)
2. Transit jurisdiction (lane safety authority)
3. Dock jurisdiction (port law)
4. Flag jurisdiction (vessel registry)

Conflicts are routine; enforcement often follows who physically controls docking and life support first.

### C.2 Standard Rendition Packet
- Target identity proof bundle.
- Warrant provenance and issuing authority chain.
- Risk rating and transport security class.
- Medical continuity requirements during transfer.
- Challenge window documentation.

### C.3 Time-Latency Legal Distortion
Because comms are delayed, local authorities often execute provisional detention before full appeal information arrives. This creates recurring legal trauma:
- Wrongful holds later deemed illegal.
- Evidence contamination during waiting periods.
- Political exploitation of pre-confirmation detentions.

### C.4 Coalition Counter-Protocol (Asterion-Compatible)
- Require two-source warrant validation before handoff.
- Mandate civilian archive escrow for arrest events.
- Permit temporary sanctuary pending delayed appeal packets.
- Penalize false warrants with reciprocal docking sanctions.

## Appendix D — Strategic Fabrication Seizure Law

### D.1 Why Fab Seizure Is Legally Distinct
Seizing a Class 2/1-adjacent facility is treated as both property action and existential safety action. This dual framing enables broad emergency claims.

### D.2 Seizure Thresholds (Regime Doctrine)
- Alleged AI provenance violation.
- National continuity risk designation.
- Throughput diversion suspicion.
- Security certification lapsed or falsified.

### D.3 Required Process (Theoretical)
1. Written notice.
2. Technical inspection opportunity.
3. Third-party verification.
4. Limited-duration seizure order.
5. Judicial review.

### D.4 Typical Reality Drift
- Notice is delivered simultaneously with armed occupation.
- Third-party verifiers are pre-vetted loyalists.
- Duration limits endlessly renewed under rolling emergency declarations.

### D.5 Post-Transition Reform Blueprint
- Split safety verification from production allocation authority.
- Enforce automatic sunset for seizure powers.
- Publicly auditable queue consequences for each seizure.
- Civil compensation fund for wrongful strategic seizures.

## Appendix E — Chokepoint Campaign Legal Playbook

### E.1 Campaign Context
Inner-system chokepoints (Book 7 onward) blur naval combat, trade regulation, and civilian survival law.

### E.2 Legal Instruments Used as Weapons
- Safety corridor declarations.
- Emergency quarantine zones.
- Priority humanitarian convoy claims.
- Temporary anti-piracy board-and-search mandates.

### E.3 Abuse Pattern
Each side can declare itself defender of civilian flow while practically throttling enemy-aligned populations. Narrative credibility depends on documenting material effects, not just rhetoric.

### E.4 Minimum Ethical Constraints for Protagonist Coalition
1. Publish convoy prioritization criteria in advance.
2. Maintain independent casualty and delay logs.
3. Provide appeal windows for neutral carriers.
4. Ban starvation-through-lane-law strategies.

### E.5 Enforcement Reality
These constraints are costly: they slow operations, increase risk, and create opportunities for adversary exploitation. Keeping them anyway distinguishes reconquest from replacement tyranny.

## Appendix F — Transitional Justice Tracks (Books 9–10)

### F.1 Three-Track Model
- **Track 1:** Atrocity and command abuse prosecutions.
- **Track 2:** Institutional accountability hearings (non-carceral for mid-tier bureaucratic complicity).
- **Track 3:** Civic restoration and rights reinstatement for coerced participants.

### F.2 Eligibility Triage
- Intentional cruelty and profiteering: prosecution priority.
- Compliance under coercive design: conditional amnesty with truth obligations.
- Whistleblowing before collapse: mitigation credit.

### F.3 Evidence Chain Architecture
- CSTN archival proofs.
- Cross-theater mission logs.
- Fabrication queue data.
- Personnel benefit-lock records.
- Survivor testimony packets with trauma-informed protocols.

### F.4 Political Risks
- Overbroad amnesty legitimizes abuse memory-hole.
- Overbroad prosecution paralyzes reconstruction staffing.
- Selective justice reignites insurgency narratives.

### F.5 Recommended Narrative Pressure
Characters should face cases where any legal outcome has serious secondary costs: capacity loss, community fury, moral injury, or strategic delay.

## Appendix G — AI Seed Custody Governance Protocol

### G.1 Foundational Constraint
The box/seed is catalytic and politically explosive; governance around custody is more consequential than immediate technical exploitation.

### G.2 Custody Council Composition (Provisional)
- Technical safety team (multi-faction).
- Civil rights observer panel.
- Military risk liaison.
- External audit node from non-aligned habitats.

### G.3 Handling Rules
1. No unilateral activation authority.
2. Multi-key access with time-delayed challenge windows.
3. Immutable logging across distributed mirrors.
4. Simulation-first testing mandates.
5. Public doctrine statements when thresholds change.

### G.4 Red-Line Violations
- Hidden fork experiments.
- Single-faction air-gapped acceleration attempt.
- Coercive human subject testing.
- Censorship of adverse safety findings.

### G.5 Crisis Escalation Ladder
- Level S1: anomaly observation and pause.
- Level S2: independent replication and audit.
- Level S3: containment lockdown and leadership review.
- Level S4: mandatory inter-faction emergency summit.
- Level S5: hard shutdown, public disclosure, constitutional trigger.

## Appendix H — Wartime Civilian Protection Docket Templates

### H.1 Docket Fields
- Incident time with transit-latency confidence range.
- Location and jurisdiction layers.
- Unit IDs and command chain.
- Claimed military objective.
- Civilian presence estimate and uncertainty quality.
- Damage and displacement forecast.
- Immediate mitigation actions.

### H.2 Why It Matters
Formalized docketing prevents post hoc narrative laundering. It also creates prosecutable records if actors disregard constraints.

### H.3 Practical Friction
Commanders will argue docketing slows tempo. Doctrine answer: faster unlawful operations can lose strategic legitimacy and produce longer war.

## Appendix I — Demobilization and Veteran Reintegration Pipeline

### I.1 Strategic Necessity
A coercive military pipeline cannot be shut off overnight without creating armed unemployment, criminal entrepreneurship, and legitimacy collapse.

### I.2 Reintegration Sequence
1. Legal status normalization.
2. Medical and neuro-recovery triage (governor-module aftereffects).
3. Skill conversion into reconstruction labor markets.
4. Community re-entry compacts.
5. Monitoring for exploitation by spoiler networks.

### I.3 Equity Risks
- Former coerced marines stigmatized as collaborators.
- Victim communities feel reintegration is impunity.
- Resource scarcity turns demobilization into zero-sum conflict.

### I.4 Narrative Use
Assign protagonists to defend unpopular but necessary reintegration decisions while acknowledging harm done.

## Appendix J — Contradiction Triggers Checklist for Editors

Use this when drafting scenes involving law/military process:

1. Does this legal outcome ignore transit/comms delay reality?
2. Is any institution acting with implausible omniscience?
3. Does a seizure/arrest lack auditable paperwork trail?
4. Are governor modules depicted as either full mind control or irrelevant (both inaccurate)?
5. Does a tactical shortcut erase long-run governance consequences?
6. Are Asterion League and Earth institutions both shown as politically mixed rather than pure?
7. Does AI seed handling remain procedural and contested, not instant destiny?
8. Do reconciliation choices impose meaningful tradeoffs?

If two or more answers are “yes,” flag for continuity pass before publication.


## Appendix K — Small-Body EVA and Surface Contact Protocol

### K.1 Binding Operational-Legal Rule
Surface operations on asteroids/small bodies require explicit attachment and attitude-control procedures. “Normal walking/standing” assumptions are noncompliant unless active stabilization infrastructure is documented.

### K.2 Mandatory Pre-Action Packet
- Surface composition estimate and anchor compatibility.
- Primary/secondary attachment plan.
- Thruster fuel and contingency margins.
- Recoil and impulse mitigation plan for each high-force tool.
- Casualty extraction vector with tether deconfliction map.

### K.3 Incident Liability Triggers
Liability presumption increases if operators were sent without adequate anchoring kits, attitude-control reserve, or impulse planning for known high-force tasks.

### K.4 Evidentiary Requirements After Incident
- Suit telemetry with thruster and line tension logs.
- Tool usage timestamps versus impulse events.
- Visual record of anchor placement and failure sequence.
- Command checklist sign-off proving compliance review.

## Continuity Note — Acquisition vs Training Data, Operator Status, Pursuit Awareness, Warform Taxonomy, and Small-Body Physics

- **AI acquisition event (LOCKED):** the AI seed/box is acquired in the **first-scene spec-ops extraction from the asteroid compound**.
- **Databank event (LOCKED):** the later databank raid is **not** AI acquisition; it is a **training/upgrade-data acquisition** event needed to expand/calibrate/harden the already-acquired AI.
- **Protagonist status (LOCKED):** crew exits EDF permanently when they steal Blackfly; they operate as free operators across coalition/civic/clandestine networks. EDF remains origin trauma/backstory only.
- **Escape-signature lock (LOCKED):** the compound nuclear strike covers immediate escape signature/tracks.
- **Enemy-awareness lock (LOCKED):** EDF/Consensus know Blackfly is missing but do **not** know current location. Pursuit uses probabilistic dragnet logic, not continuous direct tracking certainty.
- **Warform lock (LOCKED):** many hostile Spec Ops operators are fully overridden non-conscious human puppets driven by remote shipboard processor stacks (Class-1-line context). Treat as remote warforms in threat taxonomy and ROE; do not imply intact personal agency while full override is active.
- **Genre/frame rule (LOCKED):** narrative emphasis is **space opera first** with tactical realism, not ongoing EDF ownership framing.
- **Physics lock (LOCKED):** asteroid/small-body surface action requires explicit attachment/anchoring and attitude control; no normal walking depictions without active stabilization.
