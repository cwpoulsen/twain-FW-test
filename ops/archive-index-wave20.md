# Archive Index — Wave 20

Purpose: Quick domain-by-domain map of major repository documents, with one-line intent and review priority.

Role boundary note: this file is a broad catalog; for deduplicated routing ownership and keep/merge/archive recommendations, see `ops/doc-map-dedupe-wave24.md`.

Priority tags:
- **[must-read]** = Core source-of-truth docs for understanding canon and execution flow
- **[secondary]** = Important expansion/context docs used frequently in planning or verification
- **[reference]** = Supporting docs for targeted lookups, QA evidence, or implementation detail
