## Appendix L — Coalition Command Topology Under Latency

### L.1 Problem Statement
The coalition cannot command like a single nation-state fleet. Communications delay, heterogeneous doctrine, and mixed legitimacy obligations force a layered command architecture where strategic intent is centralized but tactical authority is distributed. Any depiction of instantaneous cross-theater command convergence violates transit/comms constraints.

### L.2 Layered Command Model
- **Layer S (Strategic Council):** sets campaign objectives, red lines, and inter-theater resource priorities on multi-day cadence.
- **Layer O (Operational Cells):** theater-specific planning groups with delegated authority to adapt objective sequencing.
- **Layer T (Tactical Commands):** local commanders act under pre-approved option trees when updates are stale.
- **Layer C (Civil Safeguard Channel):** parallel authority that can halt or constrain tactical options on civilian-protection grounds.

### L.3 Delegation Envelope Design
Delegation packets must include:
1. Objective hierarchy (must/should/may).
2. Non-negotiable legal constraints.
3. Expected telemetry blackout durations.
4. Pre-authorized branch actions for key contingencies.
5. Trigger conditions requiring mandatory pause.

### L.4 Predictable Failure Modes
- Overly narrow delegation causes paralysis during comms delay.
- Overly broad delegation creates unilateral escalation and coalition distrust.
- Civil channel vetoes issued too frequently are perceived as tactical sabotage.
- Operational cells hoard intelligence to win resource allocation disputes.

### L.5 Scene Guidance
Show commanders arguing about branch authority *before* contact, not only after failures. Realistic command doctrine is mostly pre-commitment design.

## Appendix M — Wartime Economy Model: Throughput, Queue Sovereignty, and Moral Hazard

### M.1 Foundational Assumption
Wartime economy in this setting is not market-versus-plan; it is queue-governance over constrained strategic throughput. Control of fab classes, feedstock lanes, and certified technicians determines survival and legitimacy.

### M.2 Strategic Economic Variables
- **Q2/Q1 availability:** practical output windows for high-value fabrication.
- **Feedstock reliability index:** expected interruption frequency due to raid/sabotage/lane law.
- **Certification bottleneck factor:** number of trusted teams that can validate safety-critical outputs.
- **Latency-adjusted demand distortion:** mismatch between requests and current reality due to stale data.

### M.3 Allocation Regimes Compared
1. **Central emergency allocator:** fast concentration, high abuse risk.
2. **Federated quota compact:** slower consensus, stronger legitimacy.
3. **Auctioned priority rights:** efficient under stability, disastrous under coercion and capture.
4. **Reciprocity-credit cooperative:** resilient socially, brittle under large adversarial shocks.

No regime is universally superior. Campaign phase determines best-fit mix.

### M.4 Black Market and Grey Corridor Dynamics
When legal allocation ignores urgent survival needs, grey markets emerge as adaptive institutions. They are not mere criminality; they are shadow governance. The coalition must decide where to absorb, regulate, or suppress them.

### M.5 Moral Hazard Traps
- Compensation guarantees can incentivize risky convoy behavior.
- Guaranteed rescue norms can be gamed by predatory operators.
- Emergency seizure powers discourage private maintenance investment if expropriation risk is high.

### M.6 Practical Writing Rule
Whenever a faction “wins” an allocation battle, immediately identify who bears hidden cost: delayed meds, degraded hull inspection cadence, technician burnout, or political alienation.

## Appendix N — Legal Interoperability Charter (Provisional)

### N.1 Purpose
Establish minimal legal interoperability among coalition members without requiring immediate constitutional unification.

### N.2 Minimum Common Rules
1. Two-source warrant validation for interjurisdictional arrest.
2. Mandatory custody health baseline logging.
3. Civilian archive escrow copy for every high-force action.
4. Appeal-window disclosure with latency-adjusted deadlines.
5. Explicit prohibition on retroactive emergency decrees.

### N.3 Recognition Tiers
- **Tier A:** full mutual recognition of warrants/judgments.
- **Tier B:** conditional recognition pending local review.
- **Tier C:** no automatic recognition; emergency-only cooperation.

### N.4 Dispute Resolution Sequence
- Step 1: bilateral legal channel.
- Step 2: neutral arbitration panel.
- Step 3: temporary sanctuary default if appeal packet delayed beyond set tolerance.
- Step 4: reciprocal docking sanctions for repeated bad-faith requests.

### N.5 Abuse Prevention
Require quarterly publication of anonymized statistics: detentions, failed validations, appeal reversals, and health incidents in custody transfer.

## Appendix O — Governor-Module Legacy Exposure and Remediation Framework

### O.1 Why This Matters
Governor modules create lifelong legal and medical aftereffects. A post-conflict order that ignores module legacy turns coerced veterans into permanent second-class citizens or insurgent recruitment pools.

### O.2 Exposure Categories
- **Category G0:** minimal exposure, reversible inhibition traces.
- **Category G1:** recurrent override episodes, moderate autonomic disruption.
- **Category G2:** chronic control-signal injury, severe psychosocial impact.
- **Category G3:** catastrophic neurological compromise requiring long-term support.

### O.3 Rights Floor for Affected Individuals
1. Presumption of coercion in conduct tied to verified override windows.
2. Priority medical access independent of political loyalty score.
3. Protected testimony channels in accountability hearings.
4. Anti-discrimination protections in reconstruction labor markets.

### O.4 Evidentiary Protocol
Blend telemetry, command logs, witness testimony, and forensic neuro-readings; never rely on one stream alone.

### O.5 Narrative Use
Module legacy should shape interpersonal trust arcs, employment conflicts, and judicial outcomes. It should not be a one-scene trauma token.

## Appendix P — Fabrication Seizure and Requisition Differential

### P.1 Distinction
- **Seizure:** transfer of control based on alleged illegality/safety threat.
- **Requisition:** temporary compulsory use under declared emergency with compensation mechanism.

Conflating them enables authoritarian drift and postwar legal collapse.

### P.2 Requisition Preconditions
- Demonstrated imminent shortage with quantified impact.
- Inability to satisfy need via contracted supply within tolerance window.
- Published sunset date and audit plan.
- Compensation formula pre-filed and escrow funded.

### P.3 Seizure Preconditions
- Specific, testable allegation of prohibited operation.
- Independent technical observer inclusion.
- Chain-of-custody protocol for all confiscated substrates.
- Mandatory adversarial review within fixed period.

### P.4 Audit Metrics
- Number of actions initiated, sustained, reversed.
- Time to review completion.
- Throughput effects on civilian critical queues.
- Error rates by jurisdiction and command sponsor.

## Appendix Q — Coalition Finance and Reconstruction Instruments

### Q.1 Emergency Instruments
- **Life-support continuity bonds:** short tenor, repayment linked to stabilized habitat output.
- **Convoy risk pools:** pooled insurance with behavior-adjusted premiums.
- **Rebuild warrants:** future production rights exchanged for immediate repair capital.

### Q.2 Governance Safeguards
- Public issuance ledgers mirrored across CSTN-compatible nodes.
- Conflict-of-interest disclosures for allocation officials.
- Cap on war-profiteering margin in emergency contracts.

### Q.3 Default and Legitimacy
Default is not only financial failure; it is narrative failure. If civilians perceive reconstruction debt as victor tribute, insurgency narratives strengthen.

### Q.4 Recommended Story Pressure
Make protagonists choose between fiscally prudent but politically toxic options and politically popular but structurally fragile commitments.

## Appendix R — Information Doctrine: Archive Integrity Under Active Disinformation

### R.1 Objective
Preserve actionable truth under adversarial synthetic content campaigns.

### R.2 Three-Tier Publication Rule
- **Tier 1:** immediate incident bulletin with uncertainty labels.
- **Tier 2:** corroboration update with source confidence scoring.
- **Tier 3:** adjudicated dossier with reproducibility notes and dissent record.

### R.3 Operational Constraints
- Speed-accuracy tradeoff must be explicit in every release.
- Redactions require reason code and expiry review date.
- Corrections must remain attached to original record, not overwritten.

### R.4 Failure Modes
- Over-redaction appears as censorship.
- Under-redaction leaks tactical details causing avoidable harm.
- Inconsistent confidence language destroys public trust faster than silence.

## Appendix S — Chokepoint Campaign Civil-Law Overlay

### S.1 Rule
Operational plans affecting chokepoints must include legal/civilian impact annex before execution unless immediate self-defense criteria are met.

### S.2 Required Annex Fields
- Predicted convoy delay distributions by carrier class.
- Estimated medical and food deprivation effects.
- Neutral-carrier appeal process and response window.
- Monitoring node responsibilities and publication schedule.

### S.3 Integrity Test
If planners cannot articulate deprivation impact beyond “acceptable collateral hardship,” plan is presumptively noncompliant and should be revised.

## Appendix T — Contradiction Watchlist for Command/Economy/Legal Scenes

1. A commander receives and acts on real-time cross-system intelligence impossible under comms limits.
2. A court adjudicates multi-jurisdictional dispute with same-day full records.
3. Fabrication outputs scale instantly after a single facility capture.
4. Governor modules are depicted as absolute puppetry in all conditions.
5. Coalition governance is portrayed as harmonious and frictionless.
6. Emergency powers are introduced without sunset/accountability pathways.

If two or more occur in one chapter arc, run a continuity correction pass.

**Authority citations:** `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` §§6, 10, 12; `tech/governor-module-autonomy-bands-v1.md`; `ops/continuity-dependency-map-v1.md`.

## Appendix U — Operational Contracting Ethics and Anti-Corruption Controls

### U.1 Contracting Threat Model
In wartime scarcity, contracting systems drift toward insider capture, emergency overpricing, and falsified urgency claims. Anti-corruption is not moral decoration; it is throughput protection.

### U.2 Control Stack
1. Prequalified emergency vendors with public conflict disclosures.
2. Randomized post-award forensic audits.
3. Price-variance triggers requiring written justification.
4. Community observer seats on high-impact procurement boards.
5. Fast clawback mechanism for fraud-linked contracts.

### U.3 Red Flags
- Repeated sole-source awards to politically connected shells.
- Identical urgency narratives across unrelated procurements.
- Vendor performance claims unsupported by telemetry.
- Contract amendments that silently delete reporting requirements.

### U.4 Narrative Use
A procurement subplot can credibly alter front-line outcomes by delaying parts, degrading trust, and reallocating convoy protection.

## Appendix X — Chokepoint Resource Ethics Matrix

### X.1 Problem
Chokepoint control can become starvation strategy under legal pretext.

### X.2 Matrix Axes
- **Military necessity confidence** (low to high).
- **Civilian deprivation risk** (low to extreme).

### X.3 Decision Rules
- High necessity + low deprivation: proceed with monitoring.
- High necessity + high deprivation: proceed only with corridor carve-outs and independent logs.
- Low necessity + high deprivation: presumptive prohibition.
- Uncertain necessity + uncertain deprivation: mandatory pause and external review.

### X.4 Documentation Requirement
Every decision cell must record rejected alternatives and why they were rejected.

**Authority citations:** `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md` (E, H); `ops/command-economy-legal-appendices-v2.md` (Appendix V); `timeline/books1-10-strategic-reconquest-map-v1.md`.

## Appendix Z — Scenario Stress Tests (Command/Economy/Legal)

### Z.1 Stress Test Alpha: False Warrant at High-Dependency Port
Inject a falsified high-priority warrant into a port that also handles critical med shipments. Measure legal response, throughput delay, and trust erosion.

### Z.2 Stress Test Beta: Fabricator Outage During Offensive Window
A Class 2 stack fails during a campaign peak. Evaluate requisition/seizure legality, allocation fairness, and command adaptation.

### Z.3 Stress Test Gamma: Archive Spoof Cascade
Synthetic casualty clips trigger retaliatory pressure. Assess publication discipline, pause mechanisms, and escalation containment.

### Z.4 Stress Test Delta: Veteran Payroll Interruption
Reintegration wages fail for one cycle. Track unrest, recruitment risk by spoilers, and coalition response coherence.

### Z.5 Pass Criteria
- Latency acknowledged.
- Legal procedure visible.
- Economic consequences quantified.
- Civilian impacts monitored.
- Off-ramp options preserved.
