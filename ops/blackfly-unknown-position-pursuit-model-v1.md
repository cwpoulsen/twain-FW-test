# Blackfly Unknown-Position Pursuit Model v1

Status: **Operational threat-model annex (SOFT, lock-aligned)**  
Cross-refs: `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`, `ops/operations-doctrine-annex-v1.md`, `ops/legal-and-military-process-appendices-v1.md`, `timeline/books1-10-strategic-reconquest-map-v1.md`

## 1) Lock Statement

This model assumes the following canon-locked baseline:
1. Crew exits EDF permanently when stealing Blackfly.
2. Compound nuclear strike obscures immediate escape signatures/tracks.
3. EDF/Consensus know the strategic asset is missing.
4. EDF/Consensus do not know current Blackfly location.
5. Pursuit is probabilistic and system-wide, not continuous live-tail certainty.

---

## 2) Strategic Consequence

Unknown-position pursuit shifts conflict from direct chase to ecosystem pressure. Instead of “find ship now,” adversaries run rolling campaigns that make survival, movement, repair, and alliance maintenance progressively harder.

### Core Adversary Objective
Constrain Blackfly options until forced to reveal itself by necessity (repair, refuel, med support, safe harbor, ally rescue, mission opportunity).

---

## 3) Pursuit Architecture: Five-Layer Dragnet

## Layer P1 — Administrative Friction Net
Tools:
- Docking paperwork expansion.
- Cargo manifest anomaly scoring.
- Serial-number cross-check sweeps.
- Identity verification overreach.

Expected effect:
- Increase dwell time in ports.
- Create procedural signatures linked to forged identities.

Weakness:
- High false positives create bureaucratic fatigue and corruption.

## Layer P2 — Economic Pressure Net
Tools:
- Fuel ration tightening by risk profile.
- Sanction cascades for suspected harbor providers.
- Repair-part scarcity manipulation.
- Insurance nullification for “non-compliant routes.”

Expected effect:
- Force Blackfly toward riskier, less reliable support channels.

Weakness:
- Pushes neutral actors toward anti-regime coalitions if overused.

## Layer P3 — Social/Informer Net
Tools:
- Reward markets for sightings and service logs.
- Debt leverage against station administrators.
- Coerced disclosure from med and maintenance staff.
- Rumor-seeding to trigger premature Blackfly movement.

Expected effect:
- Raise trust cost of every alliance transaction.

Weakness:
- Disinformation and bounty fraud degrade signal quality.

## Layer P4 — Legal-Lawfare Net
Tools:
- Associative warrants on suppliers and affiliates.
- Expanded “material support” definitions.
- Provisional detentions under delayed appeal rules.
- Inter-jurisdiction warrant shopping.

Expected effect:
- Turn neutral ports into compliance-first environments.

Weakness:
- Creates discoverable abuse records for future transition tribunals.

## Layer P5 — Predictive Pattern Net
Tools:
- Probabilistic route prediction from historical throughput needs.
- Behavioral clustering around known ally habitats.
- Maintenance-interval forecasting.
- Comms silence pattern analytics.

Expected effect:
- Narrow likely operating corridors over time.

Weakness:
- Model drift under intentional deception and low-data conditions.

## 4) Adversary Confidence Bands

To avoid omniscience drift, use confidence bands in scenes:
- **Band 0:** Unknown (only “missing asset” awareness).
- **Band 1:** Weak inference (single-source rumor).
- **Band 2:** Plausible corridor (multi-source but unverified).
- **Band 3:** Actionable window (time-limited converging indicators).
- **Band 4:** Verified contact (rare, costly, rapidly perishable).

Rule: adversaries should spend most time in Bands 1-2, occasionally reaching Band 3, and only episodically achieving Band 4.

---

## 5) Blackfly Counter-Pursuit Doctrine

## C1 — Signature Discipline
- Rotate identity artifacts and transaction vectors.
- Avoid repeated procurement patterns.
- Limit communications metadata leakage even when message content is secure.

## C2 — Mobility De-Synchronization
- Break predictable maintenance and resupply cycles.
- Alternate tempo between silence and controlled activity bursts.
- Use decoy route signals with bounded collateral risk.

## C3 — Trust Layering
- Separate humanitarian and strategic channels.
- Require reciprocal risk from harbor partners.
- Use compartmented contact protocols to reduce insider blast radius.

## C4 — Legal Resilience
- Prepare challenge packets for likely associative warrants.
- Archive all coercive legal interactions for later exposure.
- Build sanctuary and arbitration relationships before crisis peaks.

## C5 — Narrative-Credibility Shield
- Pre-brief allies on expected false-flag and bounty noise.
- Publish verifiable rebuttals when feasible.
- Never rely exclusively on secrecy; pair secrecy with trust architecture.

## 6) Failure Mode Library

### FM-01: Metadata Creep
Repeated minor interactions (parts orders, med requests, docking delays) combine into a usable location profile.

### FM-02: Debt Trap Exposure
Calling in old alliance debts too quickly forces visible movement and reveals corridor preference.

### FM-03: Forgery Saturation
Over-reliance on forged credentials creates detectable template artifacts.

### FM-04: Rescue Reflex Predictability
Adversary predicts Blackfly intervention based on known ethical commitments.

### FM-05: Harbor Capture Cascade
One compromised safe harbor triggers chain exposure of adjacent nodes.

---

## 7) Book-Phase Application

### Books 1-3
- Emphasize uncertainty, confusion, and broad legal hunting posture.
- Avoid scenes where adversary has perfect interception timing without setup.

### Books 4-6
- Show pursuit maturing into institutionalized dragnet systems.
- Pair this with coalition legal and civic countermeasures.

### Books 7-9
- Under chokepoint pressure, dragnet tightens through lane law and convoy rules.
- Blackfly mobility becomes a governance and legitimacy puzzle, not just stealth.

### Book 10
- Transition question: which pursuit instruments are dismantled, audited, or retained with safeguards?

---

## 8) Scene Construction Rules

1. Every chase beat must specify adversary confidence band.
2. If adversary appears at exact location, include explicit intelligence source and acquisition cost.
3. Use false alarms and misreads to maintain realism.
4. Show civilian/neutral burden of dragnet policies.
5. Track cumulative exposure debt over chapters.

---

## 9) Integration Hooks

- Pair with `PT-16` in character pressure tests.
- Pair with Appendix L in legal process doc.
- Pair with TRACE-L (Transit, Record, Allocation, Civilian, Escalation, Legitimacy) for mission planning.

---

## 11) Spec Ops Warform Overlay

- Dragnet interception teams may include fully overridden human warforms controlled by remote processor stacks.
- This raises tactical lethality while lowering predictability of deterrence signals (fear/pain bargaining is less effective against non-sentient puppeted units).
- Countermeasure priority: identify and break control pathways, not assume conventional surrender psychology.

## 10) Continuity Guardrail

This model explicitly rejects “omniscient hunter” framing. Enemy competence is high, but bounded by latency, bad incentives, legal overreach, false positives, and incomplete data.

## Continuity Note — Acquisition vs Training Data, Operator Status, Pursuit Awareness, Warform Taxonomy, and Small-Body Physics

- **AI acquisition event (LOCKED):** the AI seed/box is acquired in the **first-scene spec-ops extraction from the asteroid compound**.
- **Databank event (LOCKED):** the later databank raid is **not** AI acquisition; it is a **training/upgrade-data acquisition** event needed to expand/calibrate/harden the already-acquired AI.
- **Protagonist status (LOCKED):** crew exits EDF permanently when they steal Blackfly; they operate as free operators across coalition/civic/clandestine networks. EDF remains origin trauma/backstory only.
- **Escape-signature lock (LOCKED):** the compound nuclear strike covers immediate escape signature/tracks.
- **Enemy-awareness lock (LOCKED):** EDF/Consensus know Blackfly is missing but do **not** know current location. Pursuit uses probabilistic dragnet logic, not continuous direct tracking certainty.
- **Warform lock (LOCKED):** many hostile Spec Ops operators are fully overridden non-conscious human puppets driven by remote shipboard processor stacks (Class-1-line context). Treat as remote warforms in threat taxonomy and ROE; do not imply intact personal agency while full override is active.
- **Genre/frame rule (LOCKED):** narrative emphasis is **space opera first** with tactical realism, not ongoing EDF ownership framing.
- **Physics lock (LOCKED):** asteroid/small-body surface action requires explicit attachment/anchoring and attitude control; no normal walking depictions without active stabilization.
