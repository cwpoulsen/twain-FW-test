## 1) Doctrine Scope and Intent

This annex defines how anti-Consensus free-operator coalitions, allied civic networks, and transition-era security actors can conduct operations without violating core narrative constraints. It is intentionally built for conflict between imperfect institutions under hard logistics and legal scrutiny.

### Core Doctrine Thesis
Victory is not destruction of one command stack; victory is replacing coercive control with sustainable, auditable, multi-node governance under real transit and production constraints.

### Doctrine Consequence
Any operation that achieves short-term military effect while degrading reconstruction legitimacy is treated as doctrinally suspect, even if tactically brilliant.

---

## 2) Campaign Phasing Model (10-Book Compatible)

### Phase A — Survival and Proof Integrity (Books 1-3)
Mission priority: preserve people + preserve evidence + avoid terminal isolation.

Key design rules:
- Never run a mission whose success cannot be communicated credibly afterward.
- Treat archive integrity as co-equal to kinetic success.
- Build redundant exfiltration channels for both humans and data.

### Phase B — Coalition and Throughput Contest (Books 4-6)
Mission priority: convert distributed resistance into interoperable institutions.

Key design rules:
- Logistics harmonization beats hero-unit tempo over long arcs.
- Standardize technical interfaces before platform expansion.
- Build dispute resolution channels before resource scarcity spikes.

### Phase C — Chokepoint and Earth-Approach Operations (Books 7-9)
Mission priority: deny monopoly control of transit and strategic fabrication while preserving civilian flow.

Key design rules:
- Chokepoint control must include transparent convoy doctrine.
- Firepower is subordinate to lane-governance legitimacy.
- Every interdiction action must have a legal and archival packet.

### Phase D — Settlement and Anti-Relapse Architecture (Book 10)
Mission priority: prevent reconquest from hardening into successor authoritarianism.

Key design rules:
- Security tools require sunset logic at moment of adoption.
- Constitutional sequencing must match material reconstruction capacity.
- Multi-faction audit rights are not optional political garnish; they are anti-relapse infrastructure.

---

## 3) Operational Design Framework: TRACE-L

Use TRACE-L for mission planning and after-action evaluation.

- **T — Transit Reality:** Can forces and supplies actually arrive within required window?
- **R — Record Integrity:** Can actions be verified by neutral or hostile observers later?
- **A — Allocation Effects:** How does this mission alter Class 2/1 queue leverage?
- **C — Civilian Exposure:** Who absorbs risk displacement if mission succeeds or fails?
- **E — Escalation Profile:** What retaliation ladders become more likely?
- **L — Legitimacy Delta:** Does mission increase or decrease postwar governability?

A mission that fails two or more TRACE-L criteria should be redesigned unless existential emergency applies.

---

## 4) Force Composition Doctrine

### 4.1 Cell Typology
- **Recon Cell:** gathers verifiable telemetry and human intelligence.
- **Interdict Cell:** stops priority hostile transfer and seizure operations.
- **Custody Cell:** handles evidence, high-risk witnesses, and AI-seed logistics.
- **Stability Cell:** protects life-support nodes and civic services during transitions.

### 4.2 Command Philosophy
- Distributed mission leadership within bounded legal envelope (free-operator structure, not EDF chain-of-command ownership).
- Red-team legal review for high-impact operations.
- Distributed fallback authority for comms-denied scenarios.

### 4.3 Anti-Pattern
“Hero-stack doctrine” (over-centralized reliance on one elite team) creates fragility and narrative implausibility over 10 books.

---

## 5) Evidence-Centric Operations

### 5.1 Why Evidence Is Operational
In this setting, proof can shift coalition behavior as strongly as force movement. Therefore archive custody and authenticity are strategic terrain.

### 5.2 Minimum Chain-of-Custody Standards
1. Source acquisition metadata.
2. Tamper-evidence signatures at each handoff.
3. Independent witness node when feasible.
4. Time-latency annotation (what was known when).
5. Public release readiness tiering.

### 5.3 Release Doctrine
- Don’t release raw high-impact material without authenticity pre-briefing.
- Stagger release to avoid narrative saturation and discredit campaigns.
- Pair disclosures with actionable civic guidance to prevent panic.

---

## 6) Fabrication-Sovereignty Operations

### 6.1 Strategic Fact
Class 1/Class 2 control is not only manufacturing; it is strategic optionality for governance and survival.

### 6.2 Doctrine Objectives
- Deny adversary exclusive throughput.
- Protect technician ecosystems from coercion.
- Preserve feedstock routes and verification trust.
- Avoid single-point catastrophic dependence.

### 6.3 Operational Tactics
- Distributed micro-fab hardening around critical med and comms components.
- Decoy queue traffic to mask true capacity priorities.
- Technician evacuation corridors with legal sanctuary protocols.
- Counter-sabotage audits embedded in maintenance cycles.

### 6.4 Ethics Boundary
Never weaponize life-critical med scarcity to force political concessions. This is a hard doctrine line.

---

## 7) Transit and Chokepoint Operations

### 7.1 Binding Constraint
No maneuver plan can violate fusion/transit envelope assumptions. Transit delay is a strategic actor.

### 7.2 Lane Control Methods
- Sensor pickets and authentication gates.
- Boarding teams with documented legal basis.
- Dynamic deconfliction corridors for civilian convoys.
- Predictive congestion management tied to transparent criteria.

### 7.3 Failure Modes
- Over-securitization creates throughput collapse.
- Inconsistent rules produce corruption opportunities.
- Adversary propaganda paints all controls as collective punishment.

### 7.4 Doctrine Safeguards
- Publish lane rules with update logs.
- Create neutral review panel for contested interdictions.
- Include humanitarian override channel with anti-abuse guardrails.

---

## 8) AI Seed Security Operations

### 8.1 Operating Assumption
The seed changes political and epistemic balance before it changes raw military capability.

### 8.2 Security Stack
- Physical custody segmentation.
- Cryptographic multi-key governance.
- Independent black-box behavior monitoring.
- Routine adversarial simulation against containment assumptions.

### 8.3 Decision Authority Model
No single commander, engineer, or political leader may unilaterally escalate seed interaction level. Emergency exceptions require ex post public disclosure and tribunal review.

### 8.4 Narrative Pressure Tool
Create missions where failing to exploit seed rapidly is strategically painful, but exploiting it risks legitimacy and safety collapse.

---

## 9) Information Operations Doctrine

### 9.1 Principle
Information ops must target monopoly falsehood, not reality itself. Coalition credibility is non-renewable.

### 9.2 Allowed Actions
- Authentic disclosure campaigns.
- Adversary narrative contradiction mapping.
- Safety and legal explainers for civilians.
- Exposure of fabricated legal justifications.

### 9.3 Prohibited Actions
- Fabricated atrocity claims.
- Deepfake deployment, even “retaliatory.”
- Deliberate panic induction to trigger political concessions.

### 9.4 Reason
Short-term disinformation gains create long-term governance rot and make postwar legitimacy impossible.

---

## 10) Civilian Protection and Service Continuity Doctrine

### 10.1 Dual Mandate
Protect people and preserve function. A habitat with intact walls but dead service systems is operational failure.

### 10.2 Priority Preservation Stack
1. Atmosphere and life support.
2. Medical stabilization and evacuation capability.
3. Water and thermal control.
4. Communications integrity.
5. Food logistics continuity.

### 10.3 Damage Budgeting
Before kinetic action near population centers, operation leads must produce an estimated service degradation budget with mitigation plan. No budget = no strike authorization except in immediate self-defense.

### 10.4 Accountability
Post-mission review compares predicted versus actual civilian impact. Significant divergence triggers doctrinal corrective action.

---

## 11) Counterintelligence and Internal Security

### 11.1 Threat Model
As coalition institutions scale, infiltration risks rise faster than capability gains.

### 11.2 Defensive Measures
- Compartmentalized mission data with just-in-time access.
- Rotating verification teams for high-value claims.
- Insider-threat support systems focused on stress and coercion vulnerability.
- Controlled deception channels to identify leak pathways.

### 11.3 Overcorrection Risk
Paranoid security culture can mimic the oppressive institutions coalition aims to replace. Build explicit rights protections into CI practices.

---

## 12) Reconstruction Operations Interface

### 12.1 Principle
Reconstruction is not postwar cleanup; it is active battlespace shaping during war’s late phases.

### 12.2 Operational Integration
- Pair security units with reconstruction planners in mission design.
- Establish rapid standards adjudication for reoccupation decisions.
- Protect contractor transparency systems from capture.

### 12.3 Success Metric
Territory is considered “secured” only when local service uptime and dispute resolution reliability surpass pre-operation baseline.

---

## 13) Doctrine Pressure Tests (Quick Use)

1. **Tempo vs Legitimacy:** Can command accept slower operation to preserve process integrity?
2. **Secrecy vs Trust:** Does withholding this information protect lives or protect authority?
3. **Efficiency vs Equity:** Are scarce fab outputs allocated by need, strategy, or favoritism?
4. **Security vs Freedom:** Is this emergency control sunsetting or entrenching?
5. **Unity vs Pluralism:** Does coalition standardization erase necessary local autonomy?

If planners cannot answer, mission is underdesigned.

---

## 15) Editorial Guidance for Writers’ Room Use

- Use doctrine to create hard choices, not to flatten conflict.
- When protagonists violate doctrine, show consequences and institutional response.
- Keep jargon paired with human stakes.
- Tie each major operation to at least one institution from `canon/supporting-institutions-dossiers-v1.md`.
- Use TRACE-L in mission briefs for consistency across books.

## 16A) Small-Body Surface Operations: Attachment and Attitude Control (Physics Lock)

### 16A.1 Hard Constraint
On asteroids and small bodies, personnel do not stand or walk normally without active stabilization. Any surface task requires explicit attachment and attitude-control methods.

### 16A.2 Required Control Stack
- Primary attachment: tether harpoon, piton line, or magnetic/gecko interface matched to surface composition.
- Secondary retention: independent safety tether with quick-release limits.
- Attitude control: suit micro-thrusters or reaction-control pack for orientation correction.
- Momentum management: planned impulse budgets for every push, turn, and tool action.

### 16A.3 Operational Constraints
1. Every EVA plan must specify anchor points, load ratings, and fallback nodes.
2. Tool use requires counterforce planning (reaction bars, bracing lines, or opposing crew anchoring).
3. Weapon recoil, cutting tools, and drilling all create body translation unless countered.
4. Dust/debris plumes can spoil anchoring surfaces and optical sensors; include cleaning/reacquisition time.
5. Vehicle proximity operations must model plume and collision risk to anchored teams.

### 16A.4 Failure Modes
- Anchor pull-out from regolith shear or hidden fracture planes.
- Tether entanglement causing rotational instability.
- Thruster overcorrection inducing tumble states.
- Unmanaged recoil separating operator from work surface.
- Momentum transfer accidents during two-person handoff or casualty retrieval.

### 16A.5 Scene-Writing Rules
- Never depict normal walking on low-g small bodies unless artificial-gravity rigging is explicitly present.
- Show at least one stabilization action before high-force motion (fire, strike, drill, shove, jump).
- If a character changes direction quickly, include a reaction method (thruster burst, tether pivot, anchor transfer).
- Treat dropped objects as persistent hazards with independent trajectories.
- Any close-quarters fight must involve spin risk, line management, and orientation disadvantage, not terrestrial footwork.


## 16B) Pursuit Doctrine Under Unknown Blackfly Position

### 16B.1 Locked Threat Assumption
Post-theft adversaries know Blackfly is missing, but they do not hold continuous location certainty due to compound-strike escape signature loss.

### 16B.2 Practical Pursuit Model
- Shift from precise tailing to pattern-of-life inference and net tightening.
- Pressure transit nodes, service vendors, and legal jurisdictions instead of direct contact certainty.
- Run deception-resistant verification before committing high-cost interception assets.

### 16B.3 Counter-Pursuit Implications for Protagonists
- Mobility security depends on identity discipline and transaction hygiene, not pure speed.
- Safe-harbor decisions must assume informer penetration risk and legal leverage operations.
- Operational tempo should vary to disrupt probabilistic hunting models.

### 16B.4 Writing Constraint
Avoid “enemy instantly appears wherever Blackfly goes” beats unless explicitly justified by newly established intel compromise.

## 16C) Threat Taxonomy Update — Remote Human Warforms (Spec Ops Puppet Lock)

### 16C.1 Locked Threat Definition
Many hostile Spec Ops operators are non-sentient remote warforms: human bodies under full neural-link override, puppeted by off-body processor stacks fabricated via Class-1-line architecture (Blackfly-family context).

### 16C.2 Doctrine Classification
- Category RW-H (Remote Warform — Human Substrate).
- Tactical logic: disable control, mobility, and uplink before lethal body destruction when practicable.
- Strategic logic: target fabrication/control infrastructure, not only field manifestations.

### 16C.3 ROE Priorities
1. Uplink and relay interdiction.
2. Non-lethal immobilization where mission-feasible.
3. Rapid override-status verification on neutralized units.
4. Escalation to lethal force when civilian/protagonist survival requires immediate stop.

### 16C.4 Scene-Writing Rule
Do not write RW-H units as psychologically bargaining persons during full-override operations; depict them as externally driven tactical instruments unless override failure/recovery is explicitly shown.

## 16D) Destabilizer Ecology Doctrine — Freed Voider Bands (FVB)

### 16D.1 Threat Premise
FVB are ex-EDF rejected populations surviving as pirate/mercenary bands across lanes; they are both security threat and policy failure output.

### 16D.2 Operational Pattern
- Low-grade, persistent convoy predation.
- Contract violence timed to political negotiations.
- Harbor intimidation and deniable sabotage.

### 16D.3 Response Doctrine
1. Protect lanes with transparent anti-predation rules.
2. Target finance/refit/informer infrastructure, not civilians.
3. Pair interdiction with reintegration pathways and labor absorption.
4. Track whether operations reduce or increase recruitment funnel throughput.

### 16D.4 Anti-Pattern
Suppression-only campaigns produce short calm and long recruitment spikes.

## 16) Continuity Alignment Notes

- Aligns with canon lock that Consensus strength is institutional density, not invincible technology.
- Aligns with 10-book arc by giving phased objectives that escalate from survival to settlement.
- Aligns with transit realism by making delay and route control first-class strategic variables.
- Aligns with AI seed catalyst rule by emphasizing custody governance over instant power.

## Continuity Note — Acquisition/Databank Split, Free-Operator Status, Pursuit Awareness, Warforms, FVB Destabilizer Lock, Small-Body Physics

- **AI acquisition (LOCKED):** first-scene spec-ops extraction from asteroid compound.
- **Databank role (LOCKED):** later databank raid supplies training/upgrade data for already-acquired AI; not acquisition.
- **Status (LOCKED):** crew are permanently post-EDF free operators after Blackfly theft.
- **Escape/pursuit (LOCKED):** nuclear strike masks immediate tracks; enemy knows Blackfly is missing but not current location (probabilistic dragnet, no continuous certainty).
- **Warform lock (LOCKED):** many hostile Spec Ops are fully overridden non-conscious human puppets; ROE and portrayal must not imply intact agency under full override.
- **FVB destabilizer lock (LOCKED):** ex-EDF rejected populations form pirate/mercenary bands causing cross-theater disruption; strategic reveal ties chronic strife seeding to Consensus release-pattern intent.
- **Physics lock (LOCKED):** asteroid/small-body operations require explicit anchoring + attitude control; no normal walking without active stabilization.
