Use with:
- `series/book-and-series-arc-scaffolds-v1.md`
- `series/series-architecture-v2.md`

## Reality Gate Constraints (Applied to all seeds)

- **Low-g anchoring/recoil:** Every boarding/compartment firefight must specify stabilization method and recoil consequence.
- **Propulsion limits:** Burn-class maneuvers require heat/fuel/maintenance costs; no free repeated BC-C spikes.
- **Comms latency:** No remote real-time heroics; delayed command ambiguity must remain in decision chains.
- **Logistics constraints:** Ammo, coolant, meds, and spares are mission-limiting variables, not flavor text.
- **Human limits:** Fatigue, injury carry burden, and casualty friction must degrade performance over campaign tempo.
- **Sensor uncertainty:** ID certainty is probabilistic; ambiguous tracks must retain false-positive risk in outcomes.

- **Tactical options:** A) hard disable all modules, B) phased replacement with oversight tribunals, C) selective disable by risk profile.
- **Failure modes:** Violent chain collapse; hardliners exploit fear; tribunal backlog becomes injustice machine.
- **Moral costs:** Justice delayed vs chaos accelerated.
- **Continuity consequences:** Pays off Book 3 module contestability arc.
- **Cross-refs:** Timeline 0280-0290; Canon §8 + §12 firmware unknown; Characters Hale/Isaac.

### B4-05 — OP ASH COURT (War-Crimes Evidence Triage)
- **Operation brief:** Transitional court cannot process full atrocity record; team must prioritize cases for first prosecutions.
- **Objectives:** (1) preserve evidentiary rigor, (2) prevent victor’s justice optics, (3) include crimes by anti-regime actors.
- **Constraints:** Limited judges, witness trauma, political pressure for symbolic executions.
- **Tactical options:** A) top-down command responsibility cases, B) representative mixed docket, C) truth commission first, trials later.
- **Failure modes:** Perceived impunity sparks vigilantism; rushed trials collapse on appeal; selective prosecution delegitimizes transition.
- **Moral costs:** Any triage implies some victims wait or never see formal justice.
- **Continuity consequences:** Defines moral texture of postwar legitimacy.
- **Cross-refs:** Timeline 0280; Series Book 4 question; Canon §10 cost rules.

### B4-06 — OP LANTERN DEBT (Reparations Logistics Mission)
- **Operation brief:** Deliver first reparations shipment (meds, fab credits, habitat parts) to communities most harmed by command-disposal policy.
- **Objectives:** (1) ensure delivery reaches intended recipients, (2) avoid militia diversion, (3) build transparent public ledger.
- **Constraints:** Scarcity persists; armed interception likely; recipient lists contested.
- **Tactical options:** A) military escorted convoy, B) community-led distribution with remote audit, C) staggered micro-deliveries.
- **Failure modes:** Diversion by local elites; ledger leaks expose survivors; convoy attack reignites war narratives.
- **Moral costs:** Reparations framing can reopen trauma and retaliation cycles.
- **Continuity consequences:** Tests whether new system can convert ideals into lived material change.
- **Cross-refs:** Timeline 0280-0290; Canon §§4,7; Tech logistics/fabrication files.

### B4-07 — OP MUTE PRISM (Cognitive Rights Charter Enforcement)
- **Operation brief:** Activists demand legal prohibition on covert link-salience manipulation; remnants claim such limits invite chaos.
- **Objectives:** (1) codify cognitive-rights baseline, (2) stand up independent audit capability, (3) prevent emergency exception abuse.
- **Constraints:** Technical opacity of legacy stacks; public dependency on link infrastructure; fear politics.
- **Tactical options:** A) immediate blanket ban, B) layered rights with narrow emergency triggers, C) market-led opt-out tools.
- **Failure modes:** Ban unenforceable; exceptions swallow rule; opt-out becomes privilege for wealthy only.
- **Moral costs:** Security versus autonomy tradeoff becomes explicit and painful.
- **Continuity consequences:** Direct thesis payoff: agency without collapse.
- **Cross-refs:** Timeline 0290; Canon §§3,11; Series end-state criteria.

### B4-08 — OP RELIC FIRE (Hardliner Last-Gasp Coup)
- **Operation brief:** Loyalist command attempts one final centralized reboot using preserved Consensus control kernels.
- **Objectives:** (1) stop reboot, (2) preserve kernel evidence for trial, (3) avoid destroying critical civil infrastructure.
- **Constraints:** Kernels embedded in life-support routing; coup framed as stability rescue.
- **Tactical options:** A) kinetic strike on command center, B) software lockout with insider keys, C) negotiated surrender with immunity offer.
- **Failure modes:** Strike kills civilians; lockout fails due hidden shard; immunity deal preserves future coup network.
- **Moral costs:** Mercy can look like appeasement; force can become founding atrocity.
- **Continuity consequences:** Final test of whether protagonists accept bounded power over absolute vengeance.
- **Cross-refs:** Timeline 0290; Canon §§2,12 rumor of surviving shards; Characters full squad leadership roles.

### B4-09 — OP BROKEN CROWN (Earth-Belt Dependency Treaty)
- **Operation brief:** Negotiate enforceable dependency treaty covering extraction quotas, Class-2 exports, labor protections, and sanctions triggers.
- **Objectives:** (1) prevent imperial relapse, (2) avoid total decoupling collapse, (3) build violation-response mechanics that don’t require total war.
- **Constraints:** Historical grievance depth; verification infrastructure weak; spoilers profit from failure.
- **Tactical options:** A) strict binding treaty with penalties, B) phased confidence accords, C) bilateral side deals first then multilateral framework.
- **Failure modes:** Noncompliance with no enforcement; over-harsh penalties trigger black markets; side deals fracture coalition.
- **Moral costs:** Peace terms may entrench unequal realities for a generation.
- **Continuity consequences:** Locks long-tail geopolitical stakes beyond Book 4 ending.
- **Cross-refs:** Timeline 0290; Canon §§7,8; Series end-state “negotiated dependency.”

### B4-10 — OP LAST AUDIT (Settlement Verification and Handover)
- **Operation brief:** Final mission verifies whether new multi-party controls over relay, fabrication, and coercive force are actually functioning before protagonists relinquish emergency authority.
- **Objectives:** (1) complete independent systems audit, (2) expose hidden unilateral controls, (3) decide handover versus extended caretaker mandate.
- **Constraints:** Audit fatigue, political pressure for closure, latent sabotage.
- **Tactical options:** A) full delay until perfect confidence, B) conditional handover with rollback triggers, C) immediate handover and trust institutions.
- **Failure modes:** Hidden backdoor survives; delay delegitimizes transition; rapid handover enables quiet recapture.
- **Moral costs:** There is no clean ending—only acceptable risk under uncertainty.
- **Continuity consequences:** Ends Book 4 with enforceable but imperfect order, preserving hard-SF realism.
- **Cross-refs:** Timeline 0290; Series architecture Book 4 end-state; Canon §10 and §13 continuity discipline.

## Deployment Notes

1. Promote seeds to outline chapters by preserving listed constraints first, spectacle second.
2. On promotion, add specific cast participants and assign immutable sequence index.
3. For each chosen seed, attach a one-page debrief fracture (official story vs private truth vs public release).
