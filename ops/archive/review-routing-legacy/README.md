# review-routing-legacy

Placeholder archive target for superseded/legacy review-routing and decision-routing documents.

Purpose:
- Preserve historical artifacts referenced by wave reports and evidence trails.
- Reduce active-surface routing noise without deleting source material.

Do not delete archived files; move only via explicit, approved cutover steps.
