# Canon Policy v1

## Levels

### Core
Non-negotiable truth of the setting/story.
- Breaking a Core item requires an explicit retcon decision.
- Core items should be minimal, durable, and high-impact.

### Soft
Current best understanding; can evolve as story matures.
- May be revised when better story logic emerges.
- Should not silently contradict Core.

### Rumor
In-world claims with uncertain reliability.
- Can conflict with Soft or even Core from character POV.
- Useful for mystery, foreshadowing, and misinformation.

## Promotion / Demotion Rules
- Rumor -> Soft: when verified in-text by reliable evidence.
- Soft -> Core: when repeatedly story-critical across books.
- Core -> Soft: only by explicit retcon note.

## Retcon Protocol
1. Open an issue/note describing contradiction.
2. Choose: revise old draft, revise new draft, or explicit retcon.
3. Record rationale and impacted files.
4. Update timeline + affected character/location/tech docs.
