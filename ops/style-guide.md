# Style Guide (Twain + Chris)

## Tone Targets
- Witty, sharp, occasionally sarcastic
- Intellect-forward, emotionally precise
- No generic filler prose

## Prose Rules
- Favor concrete detail over abstract exposition
- Keep metaphors technologically coherent
- Dialogue should reveal strategy, not just feeling

## Banned Habits
- Overexplaining worldbuilding in first mention
- Repeating the same beat with new wording
- Flat placeholder dialogue

## Revision Bar
A passage is not "done" until it is both clear and inevitable.
