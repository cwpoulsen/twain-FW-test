# Contradiction Scanner Checklist v1

Run this before accepting any major canon update, new scene packet, or arc revision.

---

## 1) Timeline Integrity
- [ ] Every event has sequence index + start/end datetime.
- [ ] New event ordering does not invert existing locked emotional causality.
- [ ] Travel/comms assumptions between events are physically plausible.
- [ ] If an event moved, all referenced docs were updated (character/series/scene).

## 2) Canon Layer Integrity
- [ ] New claim labeled CORE / SOFT / RUMOR.
- [ ] No SOFT claim silently overrides existing CORE.
- [ ] Any CORE change includes explicit retcon note and impact list.

## 3) Character Arc Integrity
- [ ] Turning point changes future behavior (no reset-to-baseline).
- [ ] Relationship trust/friction changes are tied to concrete mission events.
- [ ] Reveal timing is seeded in prior events and paid off with consequence.

## 4) Mechanism Integrity (No Plot Magic)
- [ ] Any rescue/intervention has communication, access, and risk mechanism.
- [ ] “Unknown helper” events are bounded by explicit constraints.
- [ ] Tactical outcomes do not require omniscient realtime control across latency limits.

## 5) Evidence-War Integrity
- [ ] Data proof beats include source, timestamp, and chain-of-custody notes.
- [ ] At least one mirrored/air-gapped copy path exists for critical evidence.
- [ ] Counterintelligence scrub threat acknowledged in continuity notes.

## 6) World Rule Integrity
- [ ] Fabricator-class access assumptions match canon hierarchy.
- [ ] Marine governor-module constraints are respected in behavior.
- [ ] Earth/Belt dependency logic remains two-way and tension-bearing.

## 7) Cross-Link Completion
- [ ] Updated docs link to impacted canon/timeline records.
- [ ] `ops/book-bible-progress-log.md` contains summary of what changed and why.
- [ ] Any unresolved contradiction is logged in holes register with severity and owner.
