## Casebook Use Pattern

This document is built for rapid mission/chapter planning. Each case supplies:
- Initial conditions.
- Institutional actors.
- Command/economic/legal conflict knot.
- Escalation path and de-escalation options.
- Continuity warning flags.

Writers can lift a case as-is or splice modules between cases while preserving causal realism.

## Case 1 — The Emergency Requisition That Looked Like Theft

### Setup
A coalition theater command requisitions a high-output fabrication line for med systems after a station epidemic spike. Local co-op leadership claims the order bypassed requisition preconditions and functionally became a seizure.

### Institutional actors
- Theater command legal unit.
- Local fabrication governance board.
- Civilian archive observers.
- Arbitration secretariat liaison.

### Conflict knot
Command urgency is real, but paperwork and compensation escrow were incomplete at action time. Community trust collapses and workers quietly sabotage throughput calibration to protest what they call legalized looting.

### Escalation path
Administrative dispute -> work slowdown -> med queue expansion -> public legitimacy crisis -> spoiler disinformation injection.

### De-escalation options
- Retroactive independent audit with binding compensation multiplier.
- Co-management period with local sign-off on production plans.
- Public incident explanation including command error admission.

### Continuity warning
Do not resolve with “everyone agrees urgency justified everything.” The setting requires visible tradeoffs and institutional accountability.

## Case 2 — Warrant Race at a Dual-Jurisdiction Port

### Setup
Earth-aligned security issues urgent rendition request for a technician linked to suspected unsafe substrate work. Port board receives conflicting advisory from coalition legal network claiming forged provenance.

### Institutional actors
- Port authority and sanctuary intake board.
- Warrant issuer office.
- Coalition legal interoperability panel.
- Dock labor union safety committee.

### Conflict knot
Docking delays threaten pediatric med cargo on same vessel cluster. Any decision risks life-support impacts and political fallout.

### Escalation path
Legal challenge -> armed posture at docking ring -> panic departure attempts -> collision near-miss -> cross-faction accusation spiral.

### De-escalation options
- Temporary sanctuary with monitored movement restrictions.
- Accelerated second-source verification cell.
- Humanitarian corridor carve-out for med cargo irrespective of warrant outcome.

### Continuity warning
Never portray same-minute definitive legal certainty. Delay, uncertainty, and contested legitimacy are canonical.

## Case 3 — Governor-Legacy Testimony Collapse

### Setup
A transitional hearing relies on ex-marine testimony regarding a massacre-order chain. Defense counsel attacks memory reliability due to documented override episodes.

### Institutional actors
- Transitional justice panel.
- Neuro-forensics team.
- Survivor council representatives.
- Defense and prosecution evidence officers.

### Conflict knot
Truth-seeking and fairness collide: discounting testimony erases coercive realities; over-crediting it without corroboration risks wrongful conviction.

### Escalation path
Hearing interruption -> protest split between survivor blocs -> media narrative weaponization -> amnesty framework destabilization.

### De-escalation options
- Multi-stream corroboration requirement (telemetry + logs + witness convergence).
- Trauma-informed testimony protocol with uncertainty framing.
- Separate factual findings from moral accountability statements.

### Continuity warning
Avoid binary framing (“testimony invalid” vs “testimony unquestionable”). The world’s legal complexity is the point.

## Case 4 — Chokepoint Safety Declaration Abuse

### Setup
A major actor declares a temporary safety corridor closure for inspection anomalies. Data indicates the closure disproportionately starves rival-aligned habitats.

### Institutional actors
- Transit arbitration body.
- Campaign legal review cell.
- Civilian deprivation monitoring office.
- Neutral-carrier association.

### Conflict knot
Security teams insist closure avoids catastrophic sabotage; civilians experience it as siege by paperwork.

### Escalation path
Closure extension -> deprivation spike -> neutral carrier defection -> retaliatory inspection campaigns -> military escort confrontations.

### De-escalation options
- Publish measurable reopening criteria.
- Independent inspection teams with rotating membership.
- Time-boxed exemptions for life-critical goods.

### Continuity warning
If closure is used, deprivation accounting must appear on-page; invisible civilian costs break canon pressure rules.

## Case 5 — Coalition Budget Fracture Over Reconstruction Priorities

### Setup
Post-campaign funds are insufficient for simultaneous habitat repair, veteran care, and archive restoration. Coalition chambers deadlock on allocation formula.

### Institutional actors
- Industrial chamber delegates.
- Civil chamber delegates.
- Finance and debt instrument board.
- Local municipal recovery councils.

### Conflict knot
Capacity-weighted logic favors productive hubs; harm-weighted logic favors devastated peripheries. Either path creates grievance.

### Escalation path
Budget deadlock -> project halts -> payroll interruptions -> local unrest -> opportunistic spoiler recruitment.

### De-escalation options
- Two-phase budget: immediate harm floor, then productivity ramp.
- Publicly auditable formula with quarterly adjustment.
- Joint oversight councils in top-impacted zones.

### Continuity warning
Do not resolve with “more money arrived off-screen.” Scarcity and prioritization tradeoffs must remain visible.

## Case 6 — Archive Breach and Counterfeit Directive Cascade

### Setup
A forged emergency directive appears in multiple jurisdictions ordering detention of named technicians. Several ports comply before authenticity challenge succeeds.

### Institutional actors
- Archive trust network operators.
- Port legal officers.
- Incident response communications teams.
- Technical forensics cooperative.

### Conflict knot
Rapid action saves time if directive is real; rapid action causes rights abuses if forged.

### Escalation path
False detentions -> protests -> retaliatory raids by sympathizers -> tightened emergency powers -> trust decline.

### De-escalation options
- Triple-signature validation standard for high-impact directives.
- Immediate compensation and legal redress for wrongful detentions.
- Public publication of attack vector and remediation timeline.

### Continuity warning
Never “patch and forget.” Archive breach has long shadow effects on compliance and legitimacy.

## Case 7 — Emergency Override at the Tactical Edge

### Setup
A tactical commander under comms delay executes branch authority that causes heavy infrastructure damage but likely prevents immediate enemy breakthrough.

### Institutional actors
- Tactical command.
- Operational cell review board.
- Civil safeguard channel.
- Reconstruction liability bureau.

### Conflict knot
Operational success and political catastrophe happen simultaneously.

### Escalation path
Tactical praise in military channels + civilian outrage in public channels -> coalition legitimacy split -> parliamentary inquiry and command-defense mobilization.

### De-escalation options
- Publish branch authorization packet and decision timeline.
- Joint military-civil fact-finding panel.
- Immediate remediation commitment with clear funding source.

### Continuity warning
Command realism requires pre-committed branch structures; do not retcon perfect alternatives after the fact.

## Case 8 — Spoiler Network Infiltrates Reintegration Program

### Setup
A Freed Voider broker seeds rumor that reintegration offices are covert detention funnels. Program participation drops sharply; armed unemployment rises.

### Institutional actors
- Reintegration command.
- Local community councils.
- Archive verification teams.
- Counter-spoiler mediation unit.

### Conflict knot
Program needs trust to function; trust has already been pre-damaged by prior abuses.

### Escalation path
Participation collapse -> informal armed labor markets -> extortion growth -> transit insecurity -> renewed emergency policing demands.

### De-escalation options
- Peer-led outreach by respected former participants.
- Transparent grievance and independent ombuds process.
- Wage and placement reliability guarantees with public dashboards.

### Continuity warning
Spoiler suppression cannot be only kinetic. Administrative reliability is core counterinsurgency tool.

## Case 9 — Class 1 Custody Schism Inside Coalition

### Setup
One coalition member is accused of initiating hidden acceleration experiments using shared Class 1-relevant infrastructure.

### Institutional actors
- AVRC-like safety council.
- Coalition chamber leadership.
- Technical audit strike team.
- Public legitimacy chamber.

### Conflict knot
Immediate exposure may fragment coalition; delayed exposure may normalize secret monopoly behavior.

### Escalation path
Leak rumor -> member denial -> key suspension dispute -> retaliatory withholding of critical parts -> campaign tempo collapse risk.

### De-escalation options
- Emergency freeze across all comparable programs.
- Joint forensic access with mirrored logs.
- Conditional restoration plan tied to verified compliance.

### Continuity warning
No faction should retain unilateral secret-custody privilege without major systemic cost.

## Case 10 — Settlement Referendum Under Resource Shock

### Setup
A constitutional referendum is scheduled during simultaneous convoy shortfall and habitat repairs backlog. Opposition campaigns frame the vote as legitimacy theater during crisis.

### Institutional actors
- Constitutional convention secretariat.
- Election administration authority.
- Logistics allocation boards.
- Public archive trust operators.

### Conflict knot
Delay referendum and appear authoritarian; proceed and risk participatory inequity due to material hardship.

### Escalation path
Turnout disputes -> legal challenges -> member suspension threats -> emergency governance extension.

### De-escalation options
- Staggered referendum windows with equal access guarantees.
- Emergency hardship accommodations verified by independent observers.
- Binding commitment to automatic re-vote in severely disrupted zones.

### Continuity warning
Founding legitimacy must be procedurally painful and visibly negotiated, not montage-resolved.

## Casebook Contradiction Scan Macro

Before adopting any case, check:
1. Is latency affecting decisions visibly?
2. Is paperwork/evidence part of the conflict, not background prop?
3. Are economic tradeoffs explicit and quantified at least qualitatively?
4. Are civilian effects represented with institutions and social texture, not just casualty numbers?
5. Is there at least one plausible off-ramp?
6. Does any resolution create secondary consequences for later chapters?

If three or more answers are “no,” revise structure before integration.

## Case 11 — The Quiet Mutiny in the Verification Office

### Setup
A mid-tier verification office responsible for certifying emergency directives discovers repeated pressure from senior leadership to “expedite confidence” on incomplete evidence packets. Staff are not ordered to falsify records outright; they are asked to reinterpret uncertainty language to permit immediate enforcement.

### Institutional actors
- Verification office analysts and duty supervisors.
- Senior emergency coordination cabinet.
- External audit observers with delayed access rights.
- Union-like professional association for safety certifiers.

### Conflict knot
Analysts can either preserve methodological integrity and delay urgent action, or greenlight weak evidence and risk wrongful coercive operations. Both options carry real human costs.

### Escalation path
Confidence inflation -> wrongful operations -> internal whistle attempts blocked -> selective leaks -> legitimacy rupture focused on technical governance rather than frontline commanders.

### De-escalation options
- Temporary “yellow confidence” status requiring paired human authorization before enforcement.
- Protected dissent channel that automatically records minority analyst judgments.
- Independent emergency review panel with random sampling authority over expedited certifications.

### Continuity warning
Do not frame this as a single evil superior. The strongest version is systemic incentive misalignment: speed is rewarded, caution is punished, and uncertainty is administratively inconvenient.

### Character pressure hooks
- A senior analyst nearing retirement must decide whether to leak records that could save lives but expose colleagues.
- A junior certifier from an exile family fears loss of household status if she refuses directives.
- A coalition liaison sees the office as proof that rival institutions are irredeemable, feeding hawkish escalation narratives.

Operational note: prioritize causal continuity over spectacle whenever escalation, law, and logistics conflict in the same chapter cluster.
