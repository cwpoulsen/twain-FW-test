# Wave 13 Expansion Commit Report

Date: 2026-02-19 (America/New_York)
Scope: Books 9–10 closeout mechanics build: terminal conditions, anti-relapse governance gates, postwar legitimacy tests, protagonist end-state options, and dependency/scene cross-link propagation.

## Deliverables
1. Added closeout mechanics authority layer for Books 9–10:
   - `series/books9-10-closeout-arc-mechanics-wave13-v1.md`
2. Added dependency-grid cross-link to the new closeout mechanics file:
   - `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`
3. Added scene-packet authority cross-link to closeout mechanics:
   - `series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md`
4. Added consequence-chain authority cross-link to closeout mechanics:
   - `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books8-10-wave12-v1.md`
5. Logged pass entry:
   - `ops/book-bible-pass-log.md`
6. Captured continuity guard scan transcript:
   - `ops/evidence/wave13-continuity-guard-checks-2026-02-19.txt`

## Word Counts
- `series/books9-10-closeout-arc-mechanics-wave13-v1.md`: **1319** words
- `ops/evidence/wave13-continuity-guard-checks-2026-02-19.txt`: **63184** words

## Continuity Guard Triage Summary
Evidence source: `ops/evidence/wave13-continuity-guard-checks-2026-02-19.txt`

- **A1/B1/C1/D1/E2 high-risk active-canon scans:** no hits in `canon/series/timeline/scenes/tech/factions/characters/locations`.
- **Positive-lock scans (A2/B2/C2/D2/D3/E1):** expected hits present across authority docs and policy/checklist files.
- **Classification:** hits are either (a) expected lock-presence confirmations, or (b) policy/history references in ops docs; no active-canon violation requiring hole-register entry detected in this wave.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- No miracle logistics or live-omniscience assumptions added.
- Book 9 exit is now explicitly terminal-gated (kernel neutralization, governability floor, law-clock credibility, blackmail attrition).
- Book 10 anti-relapse progression is explicitly governance-gated (G1–G8), with bounded coercion and treaty-enforcement checks.
- FVB handling remains dual-track (principal interdiction + non-principal reintegration/funnel disruption), avoiding suppression-only drift.
- Protagonist permanent-rule outcomes are constrained; founder permanence remains failure branch.
- End-state remains imperfect/self-correcting, not clean-victory utopian.
