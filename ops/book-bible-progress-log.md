    - `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`
    - `timeline/character-arc-turning-points-v1.md`
    - `series/book-and-series-arc-scaffolds-v1.md`
    - `characters/core-squad-depth-pack-v1.md`

  - Canon updates locked:
    - `canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md`
    - `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md` updated for AI-seed box payload, Asterion League naming, Blackfly Class 2, and 10-book arc direction.
  - Added quantitative constraint docs:
    - `tech/interplanetary-transit-and-comms-envelope-v1.md` (equations, assumptions, thrust/trajectory model, lane matrix, comms latency)
    - `tech/governor-module-autonomy-bands-v1.md`
    - `ops/logistics-replenishment-cadence-table-v1.md`
  - Timeline upgraded for long arc:
    - `timeline/books1-10-strategic-reconquest-map-v1.md`
    - `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md` updated with AI-seed and reconquest-phase anchors
    - `timeline/books1-4-operational-sequence-map-v1.md` reframed as Phase I of 10-book arc
  - Continuity ops synced:
    - `ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md`
    - `ops/continuity-dependency-map-v1.md`
- Post-250k reconciliation Passes 6-8 completed:
  - Specificity/novelty + clarity/compression rewrite completed for:
    - `canon/outer-system-governance-crisis-framework-v1.md`
    - `series/post-reconquest-governance-and-restoration-expansion-v1.md`
  - Regression gate executed with evidence:
    - `ops/evidence/post250k-reconciliation-2026-02-19-pass6-8.txt`
  - Closeout status artifact added:
    - `ops/post250k-reconciliation-completion-status-2026-02-19.md`
  - No unresolved P0/P1 continuity blockers; P2 monitor risks carried in holes register.
- Post-250k reconciliation Passes 0-2 executed (freeze + lock-matrix + first triage wave).
- Baseline freeze SHA recorded: `aab4870f982d18cbdad8ab1490cbb6096cf96722`.
- Evidence transcript added: `ops/evidence/post250k-reconciliation-2026-02-19-pass0-2.txt`.
- All lock families passed with no active P0/P1 contradiction.
- Patched process-traceability defect: grep suite now excludes `ops/evidence/` to prevent recursive hit inflation.
- Holes register updated with `W15-001` closed.
