# Book Bible Progress Log

## 2026-02-19
- Megapass initiated.
- Plan document created.
- Completed canon/world/series/timeline foundation lock for **Stewards of Progress** with strict causality and continuity constraints.
- Added six substantial doctrine/architecture files:
  - `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`
  - `series/series-architecture-v2.md`
  - `tech/technical-architecture-v1.md`
  - `factions/factions-doctrine-ledger-v1.md`
  - `locations/strategic-theater-atlas-v1.md`
  - `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`
- Timeline now contains sequence-indexed dated events linking macro history to character anchors and Book 1 trigger points.
- Pending next pass: ministry-level Steward chain, Belt coalition charter mechanics, postwar compute oversight treaty design.
