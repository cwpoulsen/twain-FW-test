# Contested Lanes Adjudication Precedents — Wave 11

Status: Ops-domain precedent expansion for lane courts, convoy disputes, and provisional possession doctrine.

## Precedent 1: Contested Lane Adjudication Pattern

### Fact Pattern
A civilian convoy entered a lane segment under mixed control where beacon declarations from Steward patrols and Asterion escorts overlapped by legal interpretation but diverged in coordinate implementation. A cargo manifest contained dual-use components: legitimate life-support hardware and restricted precision substrates. Intercept authority was claimed simultaneously by military security, municipal emergency code officers, and a private insurer invoking salvage clauses.

### Ruling Logic
Tribunal panels in this precedent series applied a hierarchy: preserve life-support continuity first, freeze military-sensitive payloads second, and postpone sovereignty merits until comms-latency windows allowed verified evidence exchange. Judges rejected absolute seizure when seizure would create immediate habitat mortality risk. Instead they ordered escrow transshipment supervised by neutral tug guilds with tamper logs and delayed disclosure keys.

### Operational Consequences
The ruling reduced short-term civilian harm but imposed measurable tactical cost. Military actors lost surprise windows while inspectors hashed telemetry. Convoy crews absorbed fatigue penalties from prolonged holding vectors and sleep disruption. Some shipments spoiled before release, generating compensation disputes that persisted for years. Still, precedent data show lower riot rates and reduced FVB recruitment in ports where provisional continuation orders were used.

### Doctrine Extract
1. No lane ruling may assume real-time omniscience; all evidence confidence must be tagged by latency age.
2. Possession orders must include fuel/coolant burden estimates for every additional holding hour.
3. Any warform-generated telemetry requires human-authenticated chain-of-custody annotation to prevent fabricated intent narratives.
4. Unknown-position threat models (including masked Blackfly analog cases) cannot be converted into blanket suspicion of all unregistered traffic.
5. Review windows are mandatory at 12h, 24h, and 48h to prevent indefinite emergency rule creep.

3. Any warform-generated telemetry requires human-authenticated chain-of-custody annotation to prevent fabricated intent narratives.
4. Unknown-position threat models (including masked Blackfly analog cases) cannot be converted into blanket suspicion of all unregistered traffic.
5. Review windows are mandatory at 12h, 24h, and 48h to prevent indefinite emergency rule creep.

## Precedent 18: Contested Lane Adjudication Pattern

### Fact Pattern
A civilian convoy entered a lane segment under mixed control where beacon declarations from Steward patrols and Asterion escorts overlapped by legal interpretation but diverged in coordinate implementation. A cargo manifest contained dual-use components: legitimate life-support hardware and restricted precision substrates. Intercept authority was claimed simultaneously by military security, municipal emergency code officers, and a private insurer invoking salvage clauses.

### Ruling Logic
Tribunal panels in this precedent series applied a hierarchy: preserve life-support continuity first, freeze military-sensitive payloads second, and postpone sovereignty merits until comms-latency windows allowed verified evidence exchange. Judges rejected absolute seizure when seizure would create immediate habitat mortality risk. Instead they ordered escrow transshipment supervised by neutral tug guilds with tamper logs and delayed disclosure keys.

### Operational Consequences
The ruling reduced short-term civilian harm but imposed measurable tactical cost. Military actors lost surprise windows while inspectors hashed telemetry. Convoy crews absorbed fatigue penalties from prolonged holding vectors and sleep disruption. Some shipments spoiled before release, generating compensation disputes that persisted for years. Still, precedent data show lower riot rates and reduced FVB recruitment in ports where provisional continuation orders were used.

### Doctrine Extract
1. No lane ruling may assume real-time omniscience; all evidence confidence must be tagged by latency age.
2. Possession orders must include fuel/coolant burden estimates for every additional holding hour.
3. Any warform-generated telemetry requires human-authenticated chain-of-custody annotation to prevent fabricated intent narratives.
4. Unknown-position threat models (including masked Blackfly analog cases) cannot be converted into blanket suspicion of all unregistered traffic.

## Precedent 21: Emergency Jurisdiction During Signal Partition

### Fact Pattern
A relay outage split legal communications between inner and outer segments of a contested lane. During the partition, an escort flotilla detained two freighters carrying dialysis cartridges and encrypted compute wafers. Steward command labeled the wafers probable sanction-bypass substrate; municipal physicians argued that cargo hold delay would produce immediate treatment collapse in three clinics.

### Ruling Logic
The provisional panel held that signal partition does not erase due-process minima. Judges authorized conditional cargo separation in transit: med-critical goods moved forward under bonded watch, while disputed wafers remained in tamper-logged custody pending restored relay service. The ruling emphasized that emergency jurisdiction is functional, not total—authorities may prevent imminent harm but cannot convert communications failure into unlimited seizure discretion.

### Operational Consequences
Implementation required extra tug sorties, crew overtime, and contested billing allocations. Fatigue incidents rose as dock teams reconfigured manifests under deadline pressure, and one escort captain lodged protest over perceived dilution of interdiction authority. Yet post-event metrics showed reduced mortality and lower sabotage attempts in the receiving ports compared with prior full-hold incidents.

### Doctrine Extract
1. Signal partition triggers accelerated mixed-panel review within six local hours.
2. Life-critical cargo categories retain presumptive transit priority even under active investigation.
3. Enforcement claims on dual-use goods must include explicit harm forecast if release is delayed, not merely categorical suspicion.
4. Restoration of full relay service automatically reopens jurisdictional merits without prejudice to emergency handling steps.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Adjudication logic preserves latency and evidence-age constraints; no instant omniscient rulings.
- Warform doctrine remains evidentiary instrumentality without human-like agency assumptions.
- Precedents avoid redefining Blackfly location certainty after nuke masking events.
- Rulings integrate logistics and fatigue burdens as mandatory legal factors.
