# 1-Day Deep Review Guide (Wave 17 RC)

Date: 2026-02-19  
Audience: Chris  
Goal: full-coverage confidence pass across canon authority, causality spine, domain mechanics, and residual risk controls.

## Outcomes for end-of-day signoff
By completion, you should be able to certify:
1. Canon truth and sequence authority are internally consistent.
2. Series arc + packet systems are causally coherent across Books 1-10.
3. Technical/faction/governance doctrine supports scene realism without hidden lock contradictions.
4. Remaining open risks are bounded, monitored, and non-blocking.

Current expected posture:
- P0 unresolved: **0**
- P1 unresolved: **0**
- Open bounded risk: **R-005 (P2 monitor)**

## Full-day structure (8-hour model)

## Block A (Hour 1): Orientation and release controls
Read:
- `ops/start-here-review-path.md`
- `ops/release-candidate-index-pack-wave17-v1.md`
- `ops/final-review-pack-wave17-for-chris.md`
- `ops/post250k-reconciliation-completion-status-2026-02-19.md`

Questions to answer:
- What is authoritative vs supporting?
- Which lock domains are release-critical?
- Where is risk status canonicalized?

Deliverable note:
- One-paragraph summary of release-readiness claim and evidence anchor files.

## Block B (Hours 2-3): Canon + timeline + arc spine
Read:
- `canon/canon-ledger-v2.md`
- `canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md`
- `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`
- `series/series-architecture-v2.md`
- `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`
- `timeline/books1-10-strategic-reconquest-map-v1.md`

Validation focus:
- Canonical naming and actor-role integrity
- AI acquisition chronology lock
- Betrayal/proof/reconquest/settlement causality continuity
- No sequence inversions at inter-book gates

Risk lens:
- Watch for narrative statements that implicitly reintroduce forbidden lock patterns (omniscience, timeline drift, capability inflation).

## Block C (Hour 4): Contradiction enforcement stack
Read:
- `ops/continuity-lock-check-matrix-v1.md`
- `ops/continuity-guard-grep-recipes-v1.md`
- `ops/contradiction-scanner-checklist-v1.md`
- `ops/domain-validation-checklists-v1.md`
- `ops/post-250k-reconciliation-framework-v1.md`

Validation focus:
- Is the scan workflow reproducible end-to-end?
- Are severity classes mapped to concrete action paths?
- Are exclusion rules preventing evidence recursion noise?

Optional execution step:
- Run grep families A1-E2 before making any doc edits.

## Block D (Hour 5): Scene packet + mission chain integrity
Read:
- `series/scene-packets-books1-4-v1.md`
- `series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md`
- `series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md`
- `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books1-4-wave10-v1.md`
- `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books5-7-wave11-v1.md`
- `ops/mission-seed-to-scene-consequence-chains-books8-10-wave12-v1.md`

Validation focus:
- Packet-to-mission causality alignment
- Reality-pressure continuity from packet rows into timeline rows
- Template sufficiency despite R-005 open monitor status

Audit checkpoint:
- Confirm packet structure supports operational scene drafting without introducing lock ambiguity.

## Block E (Hour 6): Tech realism + logistics constraints
Read:
- `tech/technical-architecture-v1.md`
- `tech/fusion-transit-assumptions-and-lane-calculus-v1.md`
- `tech/interplanetary-transit-and-comms-envelope-v1.md`
- `tech/governor-module-autonomy-bands-v1.md`
- `tech/fabricator-classes.md`
- `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md`

Validation focus:
- Low-g combat/work credibility
- Transit/comms envelope consistency with sequence timing
- Governor autonomy + liability chain consistency
- Fabrication ladder realism and monopoly constraints

Risk lens:
- Reject any prose interpretation that implies effortless transit, zero-latency decisions, or unconstrained fabrication parity.

## Block F (Hour 7): Faction + governance + legal mechanisms
Read:
- `factions/major-factions.md`
- `factions/factions-doctrine-ledger-v1.md`
- `factions/freed-voider-bands-dossier-v1.md`
- `ops/asterion-governance-charter-doctrine-pack-v1.md`
- `ops/ai-seed-safety-and-governance-doctrine-pack-v1.md`
- `ops/fvb-subfaction-drift-monitor-and-intervention-playbook-v1.md`
- `ops/command-economy-legal-appendices-v2.md`

Validation focus:
- Governance doctrine coherence under stress
- AI-seed safety boundaries and override controls
- FVB dual-track logic (integration + containment)
- Legal-process plausibility for reconquest governance

Risk lens:
- Ensure doctrine depth does not conflict with character agency or scene-level constraints.

## Block G (Hour 8): Risk closure review + evidence signoff
Read:
- `ops/continuity-holes-register-v1.md`
- `ops/evidence/post250k-reconciliation-2026-02-19-final-sweep.txt`
- `ops/evidence/wave17-risk-closure-r006-r008-2026-02-19.txt`
- `ops/evidence/wave16-ai-seed-doctrine-contradiction-checks-2026-02-19.txt`

Signoff checklist:
1. Confirm R-006/R-007/R-008 closure basis is explicit and cross-linked.
2. Confirm R-005 remains bounded and non-blocking.
3. Confirm no evidence of active P0/P1 lock failures.
4. Record any targeted follow-up edits as separate bounded tasks.

## Current top risks (deep-review framing)

### Primary open risk
- **R-005 (P2, OPEN monitor):** standardized scene packet template formalization is still pending, though packet sets are already operational.

### Secondary monitor risks (quality/process)
- **W8-R1 (P2):** legacy-language drift in provisional reservoir content.
- **W11-R1 (P2):** depth re-expansion may reintroduce duplicate boilerplate.
- **W11-R2 (P2):** Wave 11 integration document could regress if templated growth is unmanaged.

Interpretation rule:
- Elevate to blocker only if an explicit lock violation appears in naming, AI timing, pursuit uncertainty, low-g realism, warform agency, or fabrication ladder domains.

## Fast triage if time compresses mid-day
If you lose 2-3 hours, preserve confidence by keeping these mandatory blocks:
1. Block B (canon/timeline/arc)
2. Block C (contradiction enforcement)
3. Block G (risk + evidence signoff)

Optional first to defer:
- Extended doctrine deep dives in Block F after closure artifacts are already validated.
