# Outer-System Stabilization Campaign Playbook v1

Operational playbook linking governance repair, interdiction campaigns, and institution building under constrained fabrication and delayed command loops.

## Campaign assumptions (locked)

- Blackfly remains a free operator cell post-EDF; no command reintegration.

- Opening operation delivered AI seed/system; databank events are later training/provenance fights.

- Class ladder remains 4/3/2/1 with Blackfly constrained Class 2 and Asterion fragile Class 1.

- Nuke-masked exfil left adversaries with probabilistic dragnet, not position certainty.

- Warforms under full override are non-conscious remote instruments.

- FVB destabilizer ecology is persistent and adaptive.

- Reality Gate constraints are mandatory for all tactical depictions.

## 2. Phase 1: Corridor triage and convoy trust reboot

Commander intent: protect life-support continuity first, then narrow coercive market leverage, then harden institutions against capture. Every operation must output measurable institutional gain, not just adversary attrition.
