# Reviewer Question Bank — Top 50 High-Leverage Decision Questions (v1)

Purpose: give Chris a fast, high-signal set of review questions that force consequential decisions early, before line-level edits.

Use: at each review pass, answer every question with one of: **LOCKED / REVISE / DEFER (owner + due point)**.

---

## A) Canon (10)

1. What are the 3–5 non-negotiable truths of the setting that this draft must never violate?
2. Which current scenes most risk contradicting locked timeline events, and what is the correction path for each?
3. What information is now common public knowledge in-world vs. still contested rumor, and is that consistently shown?
4. Which doctrine/policy shifts after major wars are canonically locked, and where is that change visible on-page?
5. What is the single most fragile continuity dependency in this arc, and do we have a fallback if it breaks?
6. Are legal, economic, and military institutions behaving according to already-established canon constraints?
7. Which “cool” additions in this pass silently rewrite prior causality, and should they be cut or reframed?
8. Where does time compression or travel cadence accidentally break plausibility, and how do we re-time it?
9. Which canon rule is most likely to confuse a first-time reader, and where do we clarify without exposition dump?
10. If this draft became the new canonical source, what future-book options would it accidentally close off?

## B) Arc (10)

11. What decision at the midpoint irreversibly changes the strategic landscape, and is it truly irreversible?
12. Is the protagonist’s objective specific, measurable, and re-evaluated after each major setback?
13. What is the cost of success in this arc, and where is that cost paid on-page (not implied)?
14. Does every major turning point come from character choice under pressure rather than convenient events?
15. Which subplot currently steals momentum from the main campaign, and should it be merged, delayed, or cut?
16. What does “failure” look like by end-of-book, and are stakes concrete enough for readers to track?
17. Where do consequences propagate across institutions/factions in ways that prove scale?
18. Is escalation stepwise and legible, or are there jumps that feel like author force?
19. Which promised payoff has the weakest setup signal, and what minimum foreshadowing fixes it?
20. If we removed one act entirely, which act would collapse the story most—and why isn’t that weakness addressed now?

## C) Character (10)

21. What core belief does each primary POV character enter with, and how is it challenged by reality?
22. Which character makes the highest-impact bad decision, and is their logic believable from their constraints?
23. Who pays the heaviest personal price for strategic necessity, and does the story honor that cost?
24. Are loyalty shifts earned through observed incentives/history, or do they read as plot convenience?
25. Which relationship currently carries the most narrative leverage, and is it getting enough page weight?
26. What private fear or wound is driving each leader’s public policy choice in this arc?
27. Where does a key character show competence in their actual domain (command, law, logistics, diplomacy)?
28. Which protagonist advantage is currently too strong, and what credible limitation balances it?
29. Are antagonist goals coherent and value-rational, even when morally opposed to the protagonists?
30. What scene best proves each central character cannot return to who they were at arc start?

## D) Tech (10)

31. What are the explicit capability ceilings of core technologies, and are those ceilings enforced in every scene?
32. Which mission outcomes depend on single-point tech miracles, and what non-miracle alternatives exist?
33. Do logistics, maintenance, fuel, crew load, and repair windows match the operational claims?
34. Where does comms latency/jamming/info degradation materially change command decisions?
35. What tech asymmetry currently dominates conflict, and how do adversaries adapt over time?
36. Are sensor, stealth, and detection rules internally consistent across environments and distances?
37. Which “rule of cool” action creates downstream doctrine changes we haven’t acknowledged yet?
38. What legal/regulatory guardrails constrain deployment of high-risk systems, and who can waive them?
39. Where is cyber/AI autonomy authority unclear, and what chain-of-command language must be locked?
40. If this tech failed at the worst moment, what preplanned doctrine should characters execute instead?

## E) Faction (10)

41. What does each major faction want right now (not in theory), and what are they willing to trade to get it?
42. Which coalition alignment is currently unstable, and what event would most likely fracture it?
43. Are faction internal politics (hardliners/pragmatists/opportunists) visible enough to explain outcomes?
44. Which faction decision appears irrational until resource constraints are surfaced—and is that surfaced?
45. Where do law, legitimacy, and force diverge between factions, and how does that shape reader judgment?
46. What is each faction’s red line, and has any character credibly tested it yet?
47. Which neutral actors (civilian networks, institutions, local powers) can swing the campaign if ignored?
48. Where does propaganda/information control alter battlefield or governance outcomes in concrete ways?
49. Which faction is over-explained and which is under-modeled, and what rebalance improves clarity fastest?
50. What settlement or governance end-state is realistically achievable from the current board position?

## Fast Scoring Overlay (optional)

For each question, score 0–2:
- **0 = unresolved / contradictory**
- **1 = partly addressed / fragile**
- **2 = locked and evidenced in text**

Priority rule for next pass:
1. Fix all **0s** in Canon/Arc first
2. Then **0s** in Character/Faction
3. Then **0s** in Tech
4. Upgrade high-impact **1s** to **2s** only after contradiction risk is gone
