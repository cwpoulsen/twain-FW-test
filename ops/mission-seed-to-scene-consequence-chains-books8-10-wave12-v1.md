# Stewards of Progress — Mission/Scene Consequence Chains (Books 8–10) Wave 12 v1

Status: Consequence hardening pass for Books 8–10 endgame bridge packets.

Authority anchors:
- `series/scene-packets-books8-10-endgame-bridge-v1.md`
- `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`
- `series/books9-10-closeout-arc-mechanics-wave13-v1.md`
- `timeline/books8-10-endgame-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`
- `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`
- `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md`

Method:
- Each packet mapped across six consequence domains: character, faction, logistics, legitimacy, intel, civilian morale.
- Horizons: immediate, delayed, cross-book terminal effect.
- Every chain traces to explicit Book 8/9/10 handoff and terminal conditions in the 10-book dependency grid.

## Book 8 Chains
- **B8-S01 Kessler Bargain:** Immediate ROE compact with civilian veto; delayed tactical opportunities forfeited; cross-book protects Book 9 governability by constraining early escalation.
- **B8-S02 Dockworker Referendum:** Immediate partner verification with one failure node; delayed queue and intimidation costs; cross-book builds auditable Earth-side civil legitimacy map.
- **B8-S03 Powder Corridor Feint:** Immediate corridor continuity under restrained fire; delayed criticism + pirate escape; cross-book preserves casualty legitimacy ceiling for seizure phase.

- **B9-S04 Asterion Conditional Lift:** Immediate reduced but compliant aid surge; delayed slower repair cadence; cross-book blocks monopoly-immunity relapse under wartime pressure.
- **B9-S05 Brother Escrow Vault:** Immediate kill-switch neutralization via live capture; delayed mercy backlash; cross-book locks moral/political arc resolution and preserves tribunal legitimacy.
- **B9-S06 Twelve Microgrids:** Immediate ten-grid survival above collapse floor; delayed offensive delay; cross-book secures life-support continuity metric for transition announcement trust.
- **B9-S07 Law Clock Declaration:** Immediate neutral-bloc cooperation gain; delayed accelerated sabotage from hardliners; cross-book satisfies Book 9 condition #3 credibility.
- **B9-S08 Kernel Winter Window:** Immediate kernel escrow completion with ceasefire compromise; delayed revanchist narrative weaponization; cross-book hands Book 10 a governable but contested peace.

## Book 10 Chains

## Contradiction-Check Summary (Wave 12)
- **No miracle logistics:** preserved; transit slots, coolant, medevac, and spares constrain every strategic turn.
- **No latency violations:** preserved; command decisions use branch planning, not live omniscience.
- **No low-g handwave:** preserved; transfer-combat and maintenance actions retain anchoring/recoil constraints.
- **No governance shortcut:** preserved; transition to law announced before war end and enforced through key handoff/sunsets.
- **No clean-win propaganda:** preserved; each win carries political, moral, or operational debt.
- **No monopoly relapse retcon:** preserved; Asterion support remains conditioned by anti-immunity and audit controls.
- **No suppression-only FVB doctrine drift:** preserved; principal interdiction paired with monitored reintegration pathways.
