# Book Bible Megapass Plan (twain-FW-test)

## Objective
Build a high-quality sci-fi series/book bible to >=250,000 words with iterative quality passes, continuity tracking, factions, technologies (including fabricator classes), major/minor character web, arcs, lore canon, and hole analysis.

## Quality Bar
- No generic filler/slop.
- Grounded against premier military/space sci-fi standards (craft, coherence, stakes, consequence logic).
- Clear canonical tagging and contradiction prevention.
- Iterative rewrites with explicit pass logs.

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundations + Architecture
- Canon index and immutable rules ledger.
- Structural map of bible sections and target word budgets.
- Continuity schema (timeline, causality chain, dependency graph).

### Phase 2 — Core Content Expansion
- World architecture (Earth/Consensus, Belt, political economy, governance mechanics).
- Technology doctrine and fabricator-class framework.
- Factions and subfactions (goals, methods, doctrine, resources, fault lines).
- Character bible expansion (core squad + supporting cast + antagonists).
- Story arc scaffolding (series, books, act structure, turning points).

### Phase 3 — Supporting Systems
- Scene banks, conflict ladders, mission trees.
- Cultural artifacts (rituals, media, idioms, military language drift).
- Backstory packets and relationship matrix.

### Phase 4 — Hole-Finding + Repair
- Contradiction scan.
- Plausibility stress tests.
- Missing dependency and motivation checks.

### Phase 5 — Five-Pass Rewrite Protocol
For each section:
1. Coherence pass
2. Consequence pass
3. Voice/tone pass
4. Specificity/novelty pass
5. Compression/clarity pass

## Deliverables
- `/canon/*` expanded canon docs
- `/tech/*` fabricator classes + applied tech stacks
- `/factions/*` doctrine + relationships + operations
- `/characters/*` deep profiles + supporting cast
- `/series/*` arc maps and book-level matrices
- `/timeline/*` continuity timelines + event dependencies
- `/ops/*` pass logs + QA findings + holes register

## Tracking
- progress ledger in `ops/book-bible-progress-log.md`
- pass records in `ops/book-bible-pass-log.md`
- holes in `ops/book-bible-holes-register.md`
