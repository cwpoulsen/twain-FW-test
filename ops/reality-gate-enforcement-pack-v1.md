## Reality Gate Rules (must pass all)

1. **Low-g anchoring + recoil discipline**
   - No free-standing rifle/pistol exchanges in microgravity without explicit anchoring (boots, tether, handhold, mag-clamp, hull brace).
   - Any burst/shot sequence must account for recoil-induced drift, sight-line loss, or suit stabilization load.

2. **Propulsion and heat limits**
   - Burn class claims must match lane calculus; no “instant sprint” retcons.
   - BC-C emergency pushes require explicit cost (heat bloom, maintenance debt, fuel reserve loss, future maneuver penalty).

3. **Comms latency and uncertainty**
   - No tactical real-time command loops across interplanetary lanes.
   - Every remote decision beat must reflect one-way light delay and stale/forked situational awareness.

4. **Logistics as a hard constraint**
   - Ammo, propellant, coolant, med stocks, and spare parts are finite; resupply windows must be stated or implied by lane timing.
   - Repairs consume inventory and create later mission tradeoffs.

5. **Human fatigue + casualty realism**
   - Teams cannot run continuous high-intensity ops without sleep-cycle degradation, reaction lag, or judgment costs.
   - Casualties create carry burden: med triage, slowed exfil, morale/command friction, and future capability loss.

6. **Sensor limits + fog-of-war**
   - Sensor returns are partial/noisy/deceptible; decoys, occlusion, spoofing, and lag must remain live risks.
   - Preemptive actions must state confidence level and residual uncertainty.

## Drafting Checklist (copy into mission/scene development notes)

- [ ] Anchoring/recoil behavior shown in every low-g engagement.
- [ ] Burn class + lane timing consistent with envelope references.
- [ ] Comms delay explicitly shapes command decisions.
- [ ] Logistics depletion/repair debt materially affects options.
- [ ] Crew fatigue/casualty burden changes tempo and outcomes.
- [ ] Sensor confidence limits and false-positive risk are visible.
- [ ] Consequences are propagated to timeline + follow-on missions.

## Contradiction Triggers (force rewrite before promotion)

- Instantaneous reinforcement or command override across long lanes.
- Unlimited ammo/propellant during multi-beat operations.
- Recoilless small-arms behavior in low-g without stabilization method.
- Perfect identification certainty from contested sensors.
- Zero fatigue penalties after extended or back-to-back operations.

## Enforcement Note

Any draft that fails one or more checks is **SOFT-invalid** until patched or explicitly marked as a retcon candidate under `ops/canon-policy.md`.
