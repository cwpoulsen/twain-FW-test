# Stewards of Progress — Mission/Scene Consequence Chains (Books 5–7) Wave 11 v1

Status: Consequence hardening pass for Books 5–7 bridge packets.

Authority anchors:
- `series/scene-packets-books5-7-bridge-v1.md`
- `series/books1-10-arc-dependency-grid-v1.md`
- `timeline/books5-7-bridge-operational-sequence-map-v1.md`
- `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`
- `ops/reality-gate-enforcement-pack-v1.md`

Method:
- Each packet mapped across six consequence domains: character, faction, logistics, legitimacy, intel, civilian morale.
- Horizons: immediate, delayed, cross-book.
- Every chain traces to explicit Book 5/6/7 handoff conditions in the 10-book dependency grid.

- **B5-S02 Spiral Pier Ambush:** Immediate recruiter disruption; delayed witness-protection burden; cross-book enforces anti-FVB recruitment-funnel doctrine.
- **B5-S03 Class-2 Queue Riot:** Immediate board survival with outages; delayed shortage pain; cross-book prevents Branch C monopoly recapture at cost of throughput.
- **B5-S04 Bitter Amnesty Berth:** Immediate maintenance recovery; delayed justice backlash; cross-book keeps technical bench alive for Book 6 parity campaign.
- **B5-S05 Insurance War:** Immediate partial market reopening; delayed criminal insurance competition; cross-book prototypes inspection/sanctions/appeals framework.
- **B5-S06 Quiet Court:** Immediate procedural continuity; delayed intimidation scaling; cross-book strengthens law-first legitimacy under violence.

## Book 6 Chains
- **B6-S01 Coolant Parliament:** Immediate civilian-priority allocation; delayed escort vulnerability; cross-book proves oversight survives first sabotage cycle.
- **B6-S02 Standards War:** Immediate anti-lockout success with dock loss; delayed output dip; cross-book constrains emergence of new technical monopoly.
- **B6-S03 Ghost Ledger Sting:** Immediate ringleader capture; delayed shortage accusations; cross-book improves procurement trust rails.
- **B6-S04 Labor Mutiny:** Immediate fatigue-safe settlement; delayed backlog; cross-book improves civilian stability metrics necessary for Book 7 legitimacy.
- **B6-S05 Sunset Audit Trap:** Immediate emergency power sunset; delayed tactical losses; cross-book locks constitutional credibility for corridor law enforcement.
- **B6-S06 Spare Parts Triage:** Immediate habitat stabilization over military preference; delayed hawk backlash; cross-book reduces civilian collapse risk during chokepoint push.
- **B6-S07 Parity Proof Night:** Immediate parity legitimacy without central capture optics; delayed hardliner narrative attacks; cross-book hands Book 7 a fragile but lawful command framework.

## Book 7 Chains
- **B7-S01 Funeral Convoy:** Immediate civilian protection under constrained ROE; delayed criticism for restraint; cross-book supports casualty-decline condition.
- **B7-S02 Inspection Line:** Immediate contraband interdiction + trade backlog; delayed appeals overload; cross-book matures corridor law mechanics.
- **B7-S03 False Positive:** Immediate mass-casualty avoidance; delayed pirate opportunism; cross-book preserves legitimacy ceiling entering Book 8.
- **B7-S04 Sanctions Hearing:** Immediate enforceable legal precedent; delayed adjudicator targeting; cross-book transitions deterrence from pure force to law-backed coercion.

## Contradiction-Check Summary (Wave 11)
- **No miracle logistics:** preserved; all outcomes carry finite escort, coolant, spares, and transit limits.
- **No latency violations:** preserved; no packet depends on real-time cross-lane omniscience.
- **No low-g handwave:** preserved; anchoring/recoil discipline explicitly specified for boarding/interior fights.
- **No governance shortcut:** preserved; emergency powers require sunset/audit; legal process shown as costly but active.
- **No clean-win propaganda:** preserved; each tactical success introduces moral/political debt.
- **No Branch C recapture retcon:** preserved; open standards, rotating keys, and audit chains remain active constraints.
