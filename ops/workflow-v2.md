# Workflow v2 (Discovery-First)

## Current Mode
**Lane A: Discovery** until further notice.

Focus:
- worldbuilding system
- book bible/canon/timeline foundations
- character depth foundations
- opening scene development

## Quality Gate Strategy
Hybrid quality gate:
- generate multiple options quickly
- enforce quality through iterative refinement

### Draft Presentation Format
- deliver in ~page-sized chunks
- present 2-3 variant pages per batch
- Chris selects preferred variant(s)
- Twain extracts preference signals and reinforces winning patterns

## Rewrite Loop Policy
- Default iterative loop budget: **3-5** reprompt passes
- Twain may continue deeper when convergence is strong
- Escalate to Chris for taste-direction forks or persistent failures

## Canon Policy in Practice
- Canon must remain self-consistent
- Rewrites are expected as story evolves
- Contradictions trigger explicit repair, not hand-waving

## Agent Architecture
- Start with **fixed specialist roles**
- Consolidate only if output becomes disjointed

## Cadence Expectations
- Morning sessions: review text, refine structure, make decisions
- Drive-time sessions (future voice mode): idea riffing on structure, pipeline, and tech

## Near-Term Sequence
1. Build world + bible + timeline scaffolds
2. Lock opening scene intent and constraints
3. Explore post-opening directions
4. Transition from Lane A (Discovery) to Lane B (Production) when ready
