# Dialogue Quality Rubric v1

Score each scene 1-5 per category.

## 1) Voice Distinction
Can you identify speakers without tags from rhythm and thought-style?

## 2) Intent Density
Do lines pursue goals (persuade, conceal, test, provoke) rather than idle talk?

## 3) Subtext Integrity
Is what they mean richer than what they literally say?

## 4) Emotional Plausibility
Do reactions map to history, triggers, and scene pressure?

## 5) Continuity Compliance
No violations of canon, timeline, or known relationships.

## 6) Scene Utility
Does the dialogue materially advance plot, character, or stakes?

## Pass Standard
- No category below 3
- Average >= 4 for "ship-ready" draft
- Any continuity failure = automatic fail and rewrite
