# Continuity Holes Register v1 (Wave 3 Updated)

Status: active continuity audit ledger  
Owner: bible maintenance pass  
Last updated: 2026-02-19

Cross-refs:
- Dependency map: `ops/continuity-dependency-map-v1.md`
- Scanner checklist: `ops/contradiction-scanner-checklist-v1.md`
- Canon patch sets: `canon/continuity-patch-wave2-v1.md`, `canon/continuity-patch-wave3-v1.md`
- Master timeline authority: `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md`

---

## Severity Key
- **P0:** breaks causality or core arc readability now
- **P1:** high drift risk across books if unresolved
- **P2:** quality/clarity gap; does not yet break canon

## Hole Ledger

| Hole ID | Severity | Type | Problem Statement | Affected Docs | Resolution Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H-001 | P0 | Sequence contradiction | Databank reveal ordering conflict with betrayal lock. | `series/book-and-series-arc-scaffolds-v1.md`, timeline docs | **FIXED** |
| H-002 | P0 | Character-arc timing conflict | Valerie brother timing split across Book 1/2 layers. | character + timeline docs | **FIXED** |
| H-003 | P1 | Mechanism gap | Escape intervention lacked latency-grounded mechanism. | timeline + canon + tech | **FIXED** |
| H-004 | P1 | Identity chain ambiguity | Unknown helper identity/trust chain underdefined. | canon + future scenes | **PARTIAL (intentional unknown)** |
| H-005 | P2 | Evidence chain fragility | Strategic proof lacked explicit custody requirements. | timeline + canon | **FIXED** |
| H-006 | P0 | Payload contradiction | Box contents underdefined; now required to contain new AI seed/system. | canon + timeline | **FIXED (Wave 3 CP-005)** |
| H-007 | P0 | Strategic-balance contradiction | Class 1 monopoly assumption conflicted with new Belt capability directive. | canon + timeline + tech | **FIXED (Wave 3 CP-006)** |
| H-008 | P1 | Arc-scale mismatch | 4-book scaffold no longer matched 10-book reconquest directive. | timeline docs | **FIXED (Books 1–10 map added)** |
| H-009 | P1 | Quantitative transit gap | Need equations/assumptions for travel realism. | tech + ops | **FIXED** |
| H-010 | P1 | Governor autonomy ambiguity | Needed explicit governor-module autonomy bands. | tech + canon | **FIXED** |

## Remaining Risks (next pass)
1. **R-005 (P2):** Add standardized scene packet template with required transit/comms/governor fields.
2. **R-006 (P2):** Add Asterion League internal governance charter constraints to prevent faction behavior drift.
3. **R-007 (P2):** Add AI-seed safety doctrine (containment, test protocol, failure escalation ladder).
