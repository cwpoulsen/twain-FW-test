# Contested Lane Adjudication Protocols v1

Purpose: operations-grade legal process doctrine for wartime coalition and allied nodes.

## Operational Adjudication Protocol Stack
Adjudication in contested lanes requires a protocol stack analogous to technical network layers: intake, classification, evidence integrity, provisional order, review, and enforcement feedback. Treating adjudication as stack architecture prevents collapse into personality rule and improves interoperability across coalition, municipal, and allied nodes.

Layer 1 Intake captures who is involved, immediate safety risks, and urgent resource dependencies. Intake must be possible under low bandwidth, including voice-only and analog transcriptions later digitized.

Layer 2 Classification assigns case class and urgency tier. Classes include violent predation, logistics fraud, labor coercion, custody abuse, quarantine breach, property dispute, and administrative grievance.

Layer 3 Evidence Integrity secures chain-of-custody. Every evidence item receives provenance tag, confidence score, and contamination flags. Unknown provenance items can influence risk controls but cannot alone support irreversible penalties.

Layer 4 Provisional Orders produce immediate, reversible controls: route restrictions, supervised release, escrow holds, emergency restitution, or temporary command suspension.

Layer 5 Review and Appeal schedules reevaluation windows based on harm potential and data latency expectations.

Layer 6 Enforcement Feedback records compliance, noncompliance causes, and unintended consequences. Feedback updates doctrine tables and training priorities.

## Caseflow Timing Under Lane Latency
Standard legal timing assumptions fail in interplanetary contested lanes. This protocol defines timing models tied to expected message delay and transport cycles.

T0 (Immediate safety window): 0-6 hours local node time. Authorities may impose temporary constraints necessary to prevent imminent harm. Written rationale required within 90 minutes where possible.

T1 (Primary corroboration window): 6-48 hours adjusted by lane class. Core witnesses and telemetry are gathered; parties receive notice of claims and rights.

T2 (Interim adjudication window): 2-10 days depending on route availability. Node issues provisional findings, restitution holds, and mobility terms.

T3 (Cross-node review window): 10-45 days or longer in deep lanes. Appeals body reconciles conflicting records, applies harmonization standards, and can remand cases.

Rights clocks run continuously through all windows. If authorities miss deadlines without documented force majeure, default protections trigger: release from nonviolent holds, suspension of escalating sanctions, or automatic ombud review.

Timing doctrine must be visible to users via posted schedules and plain-language guides. Hidden timing rules are treated as governance abuse indicators.

## Evidence Confidence Matrix and Decision Thresholds
Decision quality improves when institutions state threshold logic openly. This matrix links evidence confidence bands to allowable actions.

Band A (High confidence): multi-source corroborated telemetry plus direct witness consistency and verified chain-of-custody. Supports strong measures including long-duration restrictions and major restitution orders.

Band B (Moderate confidence): two-source corroboration with minor conflicts or partial provenance gaps. Supports medium restrictions and monitored release.

Band C (Low confidence): single-source claims, noisy telemetry, or contested provenance. Supports only short-term safety controls and intensified investigation.

Band D (Unknown/manipulated risk): evidence likely spoofed, coerced, or fabricated. Supports protective separation and forensic hold but no punitive sentence.

Threshold policy forbids irreversible sanctions below Band B absent extraordinary documented conditions reviewed by independent authority. This is crucial in environments where spoofing and misinformation are endemic.

Matrix updates are versioned and published. Retroactive application requires explicit fairness review to prevent ex post facto manipulation.

## Adjudicator Training, Rotation, and Burnout Control
Adjudication integrity depends on people who can reason under stress without collapsing into cynicism or cruelty. Training programs must integrate legal doctrine, trauma-informed interviewing, sensor-literacy basics, and anti-corruption pattern recognition.

Rotation policy limits continuous assignment in high-trauma nodes. Extended exposure correlates with punitive drift and shortcut behavior. Adjudicators cycle through recovery postings with mentorship and review reflection requirements.

Burnout control is operational, not wellness theater. Caseload caps are enforced; overflow activates reserve pools or simplified triage protocols. Ignoring overload leads to higher reversal rates and legitimacy loss.

Peer review circles examine anonymized decisions for proportionality and bias. Findings feed targeted retraining rather than pure punishment unless misconduct is intentional.

Adjudicators receive protected channels to report command interference. Retaliation for such reporting is a high-severity offense with automatic external review.

## Protocol for Contested Lane Multi-Party Incidents
Large incidents involving multiple factions, civilian convoys, and uncertain initiators are handled through Incident Adjudication Cells (IACs). IACs are temporary bodies with predefined composition and evidentiary powers.

IAC activation criteria include casualty thresholds, cross-jurisdiction involvement, suspected spoofing campaigns, or claims likely to trigger retaliatory escalation.

IAC workflow:
1. Stabilize immediate safety: ceasefire lanes, med corridors, debris hazard control.
2. Preserve evidence: synchronized sensor dumps, witness sequestration safeguards, timestamp normalization.
3. Publish preliminary factual floor: what is known, unknown, and under review.
4. Issue interim accountability actions: command stand-downs, escrow holds, movement restrictions.
5. Conduct phased findings with confidence grading and dissent recording.

Dissent recording is mandatory when members disagree on causality or culpability. Suppressing dissent creates brittle legitimacy vulnerable to disinformation attacks.

Final reports include restitution pathways and recurrence-prevention directives with owners and deadlines.

## Template Orders and Reversal Logic

Template Orders and Reversal Logic is treated as a first-order operational requirement rather than decorative policy text. Doctrine assumes adversaries exploit ambiguity, delay, and administrative fatigue. Therefore each procedure explicitly states decision owner, evidence floor, reversible pathway, and accountability trigger.

Implementation model uses three rings: frontline execution ring, supervisory harmonization ring, and retrospective audit ring. The frontline ring acts with bounded authority to prevent immediate harm. The supervisory ring resolves cross-node inconsistency and redistributes workload when a node is saturated. The audit ring tests proportionality, bias drift, and unintended system effects, publishing corrective notices even when politically inconvenient.

Resource realism is mandatory. Every rule includes a minimal viable form for degraded environments: power loss, relay interruption, medical overflow, or staff shortage. If doctrine only works under ideal staffing, it is marked aspirational and cannot be used to justify sanctions. This keeps institutions aligned with reality-gate constraints and avoids performative legality.

Governance durability depends on social intelligibility. Procedures are translated into plain-language cards carried by crews, med teams, and refugee councils. Cards list rights, deadlines, interim protections, and appeal routes. In literacy-constrained or multilingual zones, visual icon standards and audio prompts are distributed so legal access does not depend on elite education.

Data governance follows minimization and compartmentalization. Authorities collect what is necessary for safety and adjudication, no more. Sensitive identity data is role-gated and expires unless retention is justified by active case requirements. Breach events trigger mandatory notification and temporary evidentiary caution on affected records.

Conflict de-escalation is embedded at each stage. Before coercive escalation, officers must log at least one lower-intensity alternative considered and reason for rejection. This requirement creates auditable friction against fear-driven overreach and reinforces coalition narrative distinction from Consensus coercive defaults.

To resist corruption, doctrine separates allocation power from review power and from narrative power. The office that grants route priority cannot unilaterally close related complaints; the office that communicates public outcomes cannot suppress dissent annotations in formal records. Functional separation is expensive but crucial in chronic emergency ecosystems.

Training cadence uses scenario libraries drawn from real incidents: forged manifests, manipulated sensor frames, coercive labor contracts, sabotage hidden inside maintenance delays, and retaliatory rumor campaigns. Teams rehearse not just technical response but legitimacy preservation under public scrutiny. After-action reviews require explicit mapping from action to canon constraints and logistics realities.

Metrics focus on behavior change rather than headline seizures or conviction counts. Core indicators include time-to-interim-protection, reversal rate by evidence band, compensation completion rate, reduction in repeat harm along treated corridors, and trust survey stability among displaced communities. Metrics are stratified by location class so high-burden nodes are compared fairly.

Failure handling favors transparent correction over denial. When doctrine fails, institutions publish causal hypotheses, interim mitigations, and revision deadlines. This approach accepts short-term reputational pain to build long-term credibility and reduces disinformation leverage by hostile factions who rely on secrecy gaps.
