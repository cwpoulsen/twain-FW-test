# Contested Lane Adjudication Protocols v1

Purpose: operations-grade legal process doctrine for coalition/allied nodes.

## Operational Adjudication Protocol Stack
Six layers: intake, classification, evidence integrity, provisional order, review/appeal, enforcement feedback.

## Caseflow Timing Under Lane Latency
T0/T1/T2/T3 windows remain latency-bound with continuous rights clocks and force-majeure defaults.

## Evidence Confidence Matrix and Decision Thresholds
Band A-D model preserved; irreversible sanctions blocked below Band B absent extraordinary independent review.

## Adjudicator Training, Rotation, and Burnout Control
Caseload caps, rotation, anti-retaliation reporting channels, and proportion/bias review loops are mandatory.

## Protocol for Contested Lane Multi-Party Incidents
Incident Adjudication Cells stabilize safety, preserve evidence, publish factual floor, issue interim controls, and record dissent.

## Reconciled Extension Modules (de-duplicated)
### Template Orders and Reversal Logic
Standardized reversible order templates with mandatory expiry, trigger, and owner fields.

### Witness Protection Under Fragmented Sovereignty
Compartmented identity handling, relocation ladders, and retaliation-risk weighted priority.

### Restitution Computation for Multi-Victim Incidents
Loss-banded compensation formulas with transparent weighting and appeal hooks.

### Cross-Faction Incident Data Standards
Common schemas for timestamps, provenance tags, confidence bands, and transfer hashes.

### Adjudication Security Against Deepfake/Testimony Spoofing
Multimodal verification plus forensic quarantine of contested artifacts.

### Command-Legal Interface SOP for Boarding Operations
Boarding actions require synchronized command/legal packet and post-action accountability record.

## Contradiction-Check Summary
- Stack assumes stale/contested information and reversible decisions.
- Timing model aligned with transit latency; no impossible instant appeals.
- Evidence thresholds block low-confidence irreversible punishment.
- Human factors controls reduce fear-driven overreach.
