# FVB Sub-Faction Drift Monitor & Intervention Playbook v1

Status: **Operational doctrine (R-008 closure artifact)**

## Purpose

Prevent FVB portrayal collapse into a single villain mass by formalizing:
1. sub-faction classification,
2. drift indicators,
3. escalation thresholds,
4. intervention and reintegration playbooks.

---

## 1) Sub-Faction Baseline Schema

Use at minimum these operational buckets (can overlap):
- **FVB-R (Raid Economy):** seizure-first cells focused on fast material extraction.
- **FVB-M (Contract Mercenary):** deniable service cells selling force to state/non-state clients.
- **FVB-H (Hybrid Political-Criminal):** grievance propaganda + coercive logistics governance.
- **FVB-S (Survival Transit Clusters):** low-capability actors orbiting predatory networks under debt/med pressure.

Narrative rule: at least two distinct FVB buckets should be active in any major campaign phase touching piracy dynamics.

---

## 2) Drift Signals to Track

### A. Structural drift
- Consolidation of multiple cells under single branding/command myth.
- Homogenized motives replacing fuel/debt/identity variance.

### B. Tactical drift
- Repeated use of one tactic profile across all bands.
- Loss of contract vs ideology distinction in incident reports.

### C. Political drift
- Reintegration-eligible actors treated as irredeemable by default.
- Principal atrocity actors blurred with coerced peripheral labor.

### D. Continuity drift
- FVB beats detached from lane economics, veteran exclusion, and maintenance scarcity.
- Suppression-only outcomes presented as stable long-term fix.

---

## 3) Drift Scoring Model (DSM)

Score each active theater quarterly (or per major arc handoff):
- **D1 Diversity Index (0-3):** number of distinct FVB sub-faction logics present.
- **D2 Incentive Visibility (0-3):** material drivers made explicit (fuel/med/debt/sanctuary).
- **D3 Accountability Separation (0-3):** principal vs non-principal actor distinction preserved.
- **D4 Policy Balance (0-3):** interdiction + reintegration both present with costs.

Interpretation:
- **10-12:** healthy differentiation.
- **7-9:** caution; add targeted variance beats.
- **4-6:** active flattening risk; intervention required.
- **0-3:** contradiction-level collapse likely; stop-line and rewrite.

## 4) Intervention Ladder

### I1 — Narrative correction
Trigger: DSM 7-9.  
Actions:
- inject missing sub-faction-specific incentives,
- add incident-level variance in methods and objectives,
- add explicit contract chain and who benefits.

### I2 — Operational correction
Trigger: DSM 4-6.  
Actions:
- split anti-piracy response into principal-target interdiction and non-principal corridor diversion,
- add labor absorption/reintegration throughput constraints,
- publish false-positive harm costs in convoy security decisions.

### I3 — Governance correction
Trigger: DSM <=3 or repeated I2 failure.  
Actions:
- external review of enforcement doctrine,
- temporary legal tightening on collective punishment authorities,
- mandatory reinstatement of veteran exclusion root-cause beats.

---

## 5) Scene and Policy Guardrails

1. No blanket “FVB eliminated” outcomes without recruitment-funnel closure evidence.
2. Any major anti-FVB operation must show at least one displaced cost (insurance shock, staffing strain, rights challenge, convoy delay).
3. Reintegration corridors must include attrition/absconder realities; success is statistical, not total.
4. Preserve distinction from warform lock: FVB actors are agency-bearing humans unless explicitly overridden.

---

## 6) Monitoring Artifacts Required in Future Waves

- Sub-faction heatmap by lane cluster.
- Recruitment-funnel pressure metrics (intake vs diversion vs recidivism).
- Enforcement harm audit (false positives, collateral service disruption).
- Reintegration throughput and failure reasons.

---

## Contradiction-Check Summary

- Preserves FVB destabilizer lock while preventing monolithic-villain flattening.
- Preserves dual-track doctrine: principal interdiction + non-principal reintegration.
- Preserves warform agency distinction and command-liability logic.
- Introduces no actor naming drift and no suppression-only miracle outcomes.
