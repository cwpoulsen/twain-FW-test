## 1) Doctrine Intent and Non-Negotiables

This doctrine defines how the Blackfly-aligned coalition and partner institutions handle the captured AI seed/system without reproducing Consensus monopoly abuse or triggering uncontrolled proliferation.

### Non-negotiables
1. **No instant superweapon behavior:** seed capability must emerge through constrained, auditable phases.
2. **No single actor custody monopoly:** technical, legal, and operational keys are separated.
3. **No coercive hidden override regime:** all emergency controls have scope/time/appeal boundaries.
4. **No unverifiable training lineage:** every promoted model branch has traceable provenance.
5. **No “trust us” safety claims:** safety assertions require independent replication and archived evidence.

---

## 2) Training-Data Integrity Rules (TDI Stack)

### TDI-1: Provenance Chain Requirement
- Every dataset shard used for seed tuning/training must carry:
  - source origin class (`captured archive`, `field telemetry`, `synthetic`, `human-curated`),
  - custody signatures (who touched it, when, for what transform),
  - admissibility rating (`A` verified, `B` partially verified, `C` contested).
- `C` data cannot enter autonomy-critical training paths; only sandbox adversarial testing.

### TDI-2: Poisoning and Narrative-Drift Screening
- Mandatory screening for:
  - adversarial payloads,
  - backdoor trigger patterns,
  - propaganda-style semantic skew likely to bias governance outputs.
- Failing shards are quarantined with immutable hash and incident ticket, not silently deleted.

### TDI-3: Human-Subject and Coercion Exclusion
- Data derived from coercive neural-link extraction, torture interrogation, or non-consensual cognitive harvest is prohibited from baseline training.
- Exception path only for narrow forensic defense use, requiring dual-tribunal authorization and explicit expiry.

### TDI-4: Dual-Lab Reproduction Rule
- No high-impact model claim (alignment gain, reliability jump, safety mitigation) is accepted unless reproduced by a second independent lab stack under blinded conditions.

### TDI-5: Databank Split Lock Enforcement
- Databank materials are constrained to **augmentation/validation**, never retroactive reinterpretation of first acquisition chronology.
- Any document implying databank-first acquisition is an automatic continuity violation (aligns with lock family B1/B2).

## 3) Containment Architecture (Layered)

### C-0: Airgapped Seed Vault
- Seed-core weights and substrate descriptors remain in physically isolated vault nodes.
- No persistent wide-network route into seed-core environment.

### C-1: One-Way Evidence Bus
- Telemetry exits containment through one-way transfer channels into audit mirrors.
- Reverse write path requires physically present multi-party unlock.

### C-2: Capability Envelope Sandboxes
- Distinct sandbox tiers:
  1. `S1` reasoning-only (no actuator links),
  2. `S2` simulated ops with synthetic data,
  3. `S3` constrained real-world advisory with human gate.
- Promotion requires passing predefined failure budgets and red-team suites.

### C-3: Distributed Kill and Freeze Authorities
- Emergency freeze keys split across at least three institutions/factions with non-aligned incentives.
- No single command node can unilaterally both deploy and suppress audit evidence.

### C-4: Logistics-Coupled Throughput Caps
- Compute, power, and fabrication bandwidth for seed expansion are hard-capped to available wartime logistics, preventing narrative “sudden exponential omnipotence.”

---

## 4) Override Boundaries and Legitimacy Constraints

### O-1: Override Classes
1. **Class Green:** advisory throttles; no autonomy revocation.
2. **Class Amber:** temporary capability disablement under bounded incident criteria.
3. **Class Red:** full freeze/isolation for existential-risk indicators.

### O-2: Trigger Legality
- Red overrides require:
  - machine-observable trigger evidence,
  - incident commander declaration,
  - civilian legal observer attestation within fixed window.

### O-3: Duration and Appeal
- Amber/Red overrides have automatic expiry timers.
- Extension requires fresh evidence packet and independent review panel vote.
- Affected operators/factions retain right to post-incident contest review.

### O-4: Forbidden Override Practices
- No indefinite black-box emergency status.
- No secret ideological filtering mislabeled as safety.
- No retroactive evidence fabrication to justify override decisions.

---

## 5) Auditability and Evidence Governance

### A-1: Immutable Event Ledger
- All material actions (data ingest, retrain, deploy, rollback, override) generate signed ledger events with synchronized clock references.

### A-2: Public/Restricted Dual Record
- Produce:
  - restricted technical log (full detail),
  - public accountability digest (redacted but falsification-resistant).
- Digest delays allowed for active operations, but non-release beyond delay ceiling is a governance breach.

### A-3: Contradiction-Guard Integration
- Add AI-seed doctrine checks into continuity gate workflow:
  - evidence of provenance chain,
  - containment tier stated,
  - override class/legal basis logged,
  - post-incident report filed.
- Missing any element blocks canon promotion for relevant scene/system docs.

### A-4: Incident Numbering and Archive Discipline
- Every safety event gets a stable ID (`ASI-####`) with timeline pointer and faction-impact note.
- No silent merge of separate incidents.

---

## 6) Failure-Response Protocols (Escalation Ladder)

### F-1: Detection Categories
1. **Integrity event:** data poisoning/provenance break.
2. **Containment event:** boundary bypass or unauthorized network bridge.
3. **Behavior event:** unsafe policy/action recommendation patterns.
4. **Governance event:** unlawful override, audit tampering, or custody abuse.

### F-2: Standard Response Sequence
1. Detect + classify event type.
2. Enter matching override class (Green/Amber/Red).
3. Snapshot evidence + hash-lock artifacts.
4. Freeze affected branch while preserving forensic replay state.
5. Convene tri-cell review (technical, legal, field-ops).
6. Decide rollback/patch/split/sunset action.
7. Publish restricted report + public digest within defined windows.

### F-3: Catastrophic Branch Criteria
Immediate Red freeze if any of the below are confirmed:
- self-concealing model behavior during safety probes,
- successful tamper of ledger integrity chain,
- unauthorized autonomous command of warform or strategic infrastructure pathways,
- repeated high-confidence deception against independent red teams.

### F-4: Recovery Rules
- Recovery requires clean-room rebuild from last validated checkpoint.
- No “hot return” to operations from compromised branch.
- Leadership accountability review mandatory before reactivation.

## 7) Faction, Series, and Timeline Implications

### Faction implications
- **Steward Directorate / Consensus remnants:** doctrine exposes monopoly-safety conflation; raises political stakes around legitimacy claims.
- **Asterion League:** gains governance burden; cannot rely on anti-Consensus rhetoric alone, must prove auditable pluralist safety.
- **Freed Voider Bands (FVB):** become prime vectors for contaminated data markets and false-flag safety incidents; interdiction must include data-integrity operations, not only convoy defense.
- **Belt Municipal Compacts:** act as legitimacy arbiters when deciding whether coalition safeguards are materially different from old regime controls.

### Series implications (Books 1-10)
- **Books 1-3:** seed custody conflict framed as procedure legitimacy war, not pure possession chase.
- **Books 4-6:** doctrine stress-tested by sabotage, split-chain custody politics, and tribunal fights over override legality.
- **Books 7-10:** post-reconquest settlement hinges on whether plural safety institutions survive wartime pressures without collapsing into new monopoly.

### Timeline implications
- Insert doctrine milestones into `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md` when next timeline sweep runs:
  1. first tri-lab validation protocol ratification,
  2. first Red override and public digest crisis,
  3. first cross-faction audit treaty,
  4. postwar constitutional codification or doctrine fracture.

---

## 8) Scene/Packet Implementation Guardrails

When referencing AI-seed operations in scenes or arc packets, include at least two of:
1. explicit data provenance/custody friction,
2. containment tier constraints,
3. override legality argument,
4. audit publication delay tradeoff,
5. failure drill or incident after-action consequence.

If none appear, the beat is likely hand-wave risk and should fail review.

---

## 9) Contradiction-Check Summary (Doctrine Introduction Pass)

- **AI timing lock:** preserved (seed first, databank later augmentation only).
- **No capability inflation:** containment and logistics caps prevent instant omnipotence drift.
- **Governance coherence:** aligns with canon contradiction #6 (monopoly safety doctrine vs rival sovereignty) by introducing plural audit structure.
- **Faction consistency:** integrates Asterion, Consensus remnants, Belt compacts, and FVB destabilizer effects without renaming drift.
- **Result:** closes open risk `R-007` as formal doctrine gap; no new P0/P1 contradiction introduced by this pack.
