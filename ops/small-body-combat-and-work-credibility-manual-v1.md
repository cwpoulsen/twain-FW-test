## 1) Purpose

This manual enforces physically credible behavior for asteroid/small-body scenes where characters fight, repair, extract, infiltrate, or survive in low-g and irregular terrain. It exists to prevent accidental Earthlike movement logic and to convert physics into story pressure.

This is a writing and planning tool, not a hard simulation engine.

---

## 2) Non-Negotiable Physical Baseline

1. Low-g small-body surfaces do not support normal walking/standing behavior without active stabilization.
2. Every force application has movement consequences for both actor and target.
3. Attachment state is as important as weapon state.
4. Orientation is a tactical variable; “up” is local and unstable.
5. Momentum mistakes compound quickly and are hard to reverse without fuel or anchors.

---

## 3) Attachment Toolkit Taxonomy

### A) Tether Harpoons
- Best for rapid first contact and temporary stabilization.
- Risk: shallow bite in dusty regolith, shear failure under lateral loads.
- Use: initial security point, not sole anchor for heavy-force tasks.

### B) Pitons/Spikes
- Best for preplanned operations with known substrate quality.
- Risk: hidden micro-fracture planes; overconfidence in old placements.
- Use: redundant anchor trees for prolonged work or defense.

### C) Gecko/Adhesive Pads
- Best for smooth or mixed surfaces where penetration tools fail.
- Risk: dust fouling and thermal degradation.
- Use: mobility transitions and short-hold manipulations.

### D) Magnetic Interfaces
- Conditional utility only when metal content supports it.
- Risk: unreliable in non-ferrous terrain; cannot be assumed default.
- Use: salvage hull operations, industrial structures.

### E) Multi-Line Belay Rig
- Two active load lines + one safety line minimum for complex tasks.
- Risk: entanglement and rotational cross-coupling.
- Use: team operations, casualty extraction, tool-recoil control.

## 4) Attitude-Control Methods

### Suit Micro-Thrusters
Pros: immediate orientation and drift correction.  
Cons: finite propellant, plume hazards, overcorrection risk.

### Reaction Wheels / Internal Gyro Assists
Pros: efficient fine orientation control.  
Cons: saturation under repeated impulses; still need external momentum dumping.

### Tether-Pivot Reorientation
Pros: fuel-efficient if anchor quality is high.  
Cons: converts linear drift into rotation if poorly managed.

### Countermass Throw or Tool-Impulse Compensation
Pros: emergency correction when thrusters degraded.  
Cons: introduces debris hazards and inventory loss.

---

## 5) Momentum Budgeting for Scene Design

When drafting action beats, include at least one explicit momentum-management moment in each high-force sequence.

### Quick Rule Set
- Push-off without planned capture = future hazard.
- Recoil without bracing = displacement.
- Pulling an opponent without counter-anchor = self-displacement.
- Tool impulse accumulates; repeated “small” forces still destabilize.

### Narrative Benefit
Momentum budgeting naturally creates tactical creativity, mistakes, and consequences without artificial drama.

---

## 6) Recoil and Weapon Use

### Firearms / Directed Kinetic Systems
- Need counter-brace or line tension to maintain firing solution.
- Burst fire may be less destabilizing than single heavy impulses depending system design.
- Missed shots remain long-lived hazard vectors in sparse debris fields.

### Energy Tools and Cutting Implements
- Even non-ballistic tools create reaction torque and contact kick.
- Continuous cutting against resistant material can walk operator off line unless anchored.

### Breach Charges
- Blast overpressure behavior differs in vacuum/low atmosphere contexts; impulse still transmits through mounting points.
- Breacher must be tied into a preplanned recoil and fragment shelter posture.

---

## 7) Hand-to-Hand and Close-Quarters Conflict

Grounded fistfight logic is invalid in low-g exterior operations.

### Credible CQC Features
- Engagement revolves around grip control, line control, and orientation denial.
- “Knockback” often destabilizes both participants.
- Chokes and holds translate into spin contests without stable base.
- Helmet and suit integrity become as decisive as strike force.

### Writing Rule
If a fight lasts more than a few exchanges, include at least one tether complication, anchor transition, or uncontrolled rotation event.

---

## 8) Tool Use and Worksite Operations

### Drilling / Core Sampling
- Requires anti-torque frame or paired counter-operator.
- Bit snag can spin body if frame isn’t anchored.

### Heavy Component Swap
- “Lifting” is easier than controlling inertia.
- Floating component can become collision projectile.

### Cable Routing
- Cable tension changes pull operator unexpectedly.
- Loose loops become snag risks for boots, wrists, and suit ports.

### Sealant / Patch Work
- Surface prep is often harder than placement due to dust behavior.
- Patch failure may begin at edge peel from micro-vibration.

---

## 9) Surface Composition and Contact Reliability

### Rubble-Pile Bodies
- Unconsolidated layers make anchor reliability low without testing.
- Vibrations can trigger localized sloughing.

### Metallic/Nickel-Rich Bodies
- Better mechanical hold in some zones; thermal expansion cycles can loosen mounts.

### Mixed Regolith-Crust Bodies
- Variable behavior over short distances; anchor strategy must adapt continuously.

### Scene Rule
Never assume uniform footing or anchor performance across one site unless explicitly surveyed.

---

## 10) Dust, Debris, and Visibility

### Dust Behavior
- Electrostatic effects and weak gravity can keep fine particles suspended around activity zones.
- Lens/sensor contamination accumulates faster than expected.

### Debris Hazards
- Dropped tools and fragments remain active risk objects.
- Line-of-fire planning must include delayed-crossing debris vectors.

### Mitigations
- Scheduled optical wipe windows.
- Tool tethers by default.
- Debris cones marked in team HUD protocols.

---

## 11) Team Movement Patterns

### Leapfrog Anchor Advance
One operator advances while others hold stabilizing lines.

### Triangle Control Formation
Three anchors maintain geometric stability for work and defense arcs.

### Drift Recovery Pairing
Dedicated buddy responsible for trajectory correction and line clearance.

### Casualty Drag Lattice
Two pull lines + one anti-spin line; no single-point casualty tow in contested environment.

## 12) Failure Mode Catalog for Plot Utility

1. **Anchor Shear Failure** under unexpected lateral load.
2. **Tether Burn/Fray** from edge abrasion during rapid pivot.
3. **Thruster Fuel Surprise** due to unnoticed corrective micro-bursts.
4. **Entanglement Spiral** when two operators cross lines under fire.
5. **Tool Kick Drift** after jam-release event.
6. **Decompression Panic Spin** following suit breach alarm.
7. **Rescue Chain Collapse** when casualty mass shifts unexpectedly.
8. **Sensor Blind Window** from dust plume or glare.

Use these as credible complications, not random chaos.

---

## 13) Planning Template (Writers + Ops)

Before any small-body action scene, answer:
1. What is primary/secondary anchoring plan?
2. What is orientation baseline and reorientation plan?
3. What are expected impulse events (gunfire, tools, charges)?
4. How is momentum managed after each impulse?
5. What is casualty extraction geometry?
6. What debris/dust effects matter this beat?
7. What fails first if plan degrades?

---

## 14) Tactical/Moral Overlay with Warform Enemies

When hostile units are fully overridden remote human warforms:
- Deterrence behaviors based on fear/pain signaling are less reliable.
- Control-link disruption has higher value than body attrition when feasible.
- Operators face intensified moral injury due to human form/non-sentient status split.
- Scene framing should show this stress explicitly in post-action decompression.

---

## 15) Cinematic Rule Set for Space-Opera Tone

To preserve “space opera first” while keeping credibility:
1. Keep movement visually legible (clear anchor references).
2. Use 1-2 signature physical details per action beat (tether snapback, thruster feather, spin arrest).
3. Let physics generate heroism (smart stabilization choices), not hinder all drama.
4. Avoid overloading scenes with equations; prioritize embodied consequences.
5. If a character does something impossible, flag it as tech-assisted and costly.

---

## 16) Cross-Document Injection Points

- Insert anchor-check beats into Book 1 asteroid compound extraction scenes.
- Attach Appendix K and Doctrine 16A references to any EVA boarding op packets.
- Pair PT-17 with micro-g motion constraints for moral + physical pressure stacking.
- Add contradiction scans for “normal walking” phrasing in revision passes.

---

## 17) Continuity QA Checklist

Mark FAIL if any are true:
- Characters run or plant-feet fight on asteroid exterior without stabilization.
- Recoil/tool impulse has no body-motion effect.
- Debris/dropped objects vanish from consequence space.
- Casualty extraction ignores line geometry.
- Rapid direction change appears without reaction method.
- Enemy warforms under full override are written with intact personal agency.

Any FAIL requires scene patch before canon acceptance.

## 18) Continuity Note — Acquisition vs Training Data, Operator Status, Pursuit Awareness, Warform Taxonomy, and Small-Body Physics

- **AI acquisition event (LOCKED):** first-scene spec-ops extraction from asteroid compound.
- **Databank event (LOCKED):** later databank raid = training/upgrade-data acquisition, not AI acquisition.
- **Protagonist status (LOCKED):** crew are permanent post-EDF free operators after Blackfly theft.
- **Escape-signature lock (LOCKED):** nuclear strike covers immediate escape tracks.
- **Enemy-awareness lock (LOCKED):** Blackfly known missing; current location unknown; pursuit is probabilistic dragnet.
- **Warform lock (LOCKED):** many hostile Spec Ops operators are fully overridden non-conscious human puppets driven by remote processor stacks; ROE should target control/disruption first when feasible.
- **Physics lock (LOCKED):** small-body operations require explicit anchoring and attitude control; no normal walking depictions without active stabilization.
