## Snapshot
- **Name:** Corporal Valerie Wells
- **Role:** Grounded ace / future high-G solo pilot asset

---

## Core Identity

### Public File Version (what command says)
- Highly capable flight trainee with exceptional reflexes and tolerance under stress.
- Conduct unbecoming: assault on superior officer.
- Demoted from Warrant Officer track to Corporal.
- Marked as high-risk for chain-of-command compliance.

### True Version (what actually happened)
- Officer attempted sexual assault.
- Valerie defended herself, shattered his jaw, nearly killed him.
- Command offered demotion in exchange for silence.
- She accepted to survive and keep any path back to flight.

---

## Origin Backstory (Canon)
- Childhood servant in steward-class household.
- Abused by first steward until discarded for another child servant.
- Reassigned to a second household.
- The household son treated her as a younger sister and taught her kickboxing/self-defense.
- Allowed private tutors if labor obligations remained perfect.
- From age 12, given access to elite black-channel strength therapies.

## Biomedical Profile

### Therapy Effects (Designed)
- Increased bone density
- Increased muscle-force output without large mass gain
- Improved high-G survivability

### Side Effects (Critical)
- Endocrine dysregulation (rage spikes / instability under stress)
- Infertility

### Narrative Function
- Power is real and earned, but never free.
- Every advantage carries personal cost and potential behavioral volatility.

---

## Core Wound / Trigger / Drive

### Core Wound
- Bodily autonomy repeatedly violated by people with class/institutional power.

### Primary Trigger
- Sexual coercion, cornering behavior, entitlement framed as authority.

### Drive
- Be stronger and faster than any man who could ever physically dominate her again.
- Get back to flying, where control is measurable and earned.

## Values and Rules

### Stated Creed
> “Only one rule matters: don’t crash.”

### Interpreted Ruleset
1. No one owns my body.
2. No one owns my mind.
3. If command endangers survival through delay or ego, intervene.
4. Protect the vulnerable when institutions won’t.

### Tension Engine
- Institution means “follow procedure.”
- Valerie means “achieve controlled survival outcome.”

---

## Competence Stack
- Elite reflexes and close-quarters violence via kickboxing base.
- High stress tolerance and rapid threat assessment.
- Exceptional in extreme flight envelopes (especially solo high-G profiles).
- Tactical intuition strong; procedural obedience weak under moral/trigger stress.

---

## Weaknesses / Failure Modes
1. Rage reflex can hijack strategy.
2. Authority conflict escalates quickly.
3. Self-worth tied to utility/performance (“if I’m not flying, I’m expendable”).
4. May pre-emptively strike in ambiguous threat contexts.

---

## Controlled Fury Arc (Milestones)

### Phase 1 — Reflexive Fire
- Rage makes decisions for her.
- Wins immediate confrontations, loses institutional trust.

### Phase 2 — Precision Discipline
- Learns that unmanaged fury is enemy leverage.
- Begins using breath/timing/procedure as weapons, not shackles.

### Phase 3 — Command-Grade Control
- Keeps the fire, removes the flinch.
- Chooses when to strike, when to hold, and why.
- Becomes strategically reliable without becoming submissive.

---

## Relationships

### Institutional Antagonist (to be named)
- Doctrine-first officer; not cartoon evil, but complicit in system preservation.
- Function: tests whether Valerie can differentiate justice from impulse.

### Brother-Figure (later reveal)
- Son of second household; taught Valerie kickboxing.
- Treated her like family when others treated her like property.
- Later becomes covert inside agent.

### Main Character (slow-burn relationship arc)
- Valerie and the main character develop a relationship gradually under mission pressure.
- Sexual tension is intentionally slow and high-friction due to Valerie’s trauma history and need for bodily autonomy/safety.
- Progression should prioritize trust signals, consent clarity, and emotional reliability over speed.
- Function: tests whether Valerie can allow closeness without surrendering control of self.

---

## Socialization & Class Conditioning
- Valerie spent formative years in a high-status household culture with a less restrictive neural-link regime.
- Elite-linked individuals are managed more by incentives (luxury, autonomy, creative latitude) than overt coercion.
- This environment gave Valerie stronger social fluency than most lower-status servants and aligns her interaction style closer to the main character’s world.
- Worldbuilding implication: control systems are stratified; subservience is enforced differently by class.

---

## Scene Design Prompts (for drafting)
1. **Denied cockpit access:** Valerie watches a weaker pilot prep a mission she knows he can’t survive.
2. **Trigger in briefing room:** Senior officer uses coercive body language; she chooses discipline over immediate violence.
3. **High-G emergency:** Only Valerie can sustain required flight profile; command must trust the insubordinate corporal.
4. **Medical disclosure beat:** Infertility side effect revealed/weaponized in conflict.
5. **False abandonment beat:** She references brother as “gone,” while reader sees hints he is active in shadows.

---

## Voice Anchors
- Language is concrete, clipped, tactical.
- Humor dry and sparse under pressure.
- Emotional truth shown through decisions and aftermath, not speeches.

---

## Red Lines for Writing
- No trauma-as-spectacle scenes.
- No “rage makes her superhuman genius” shortcuts.
- Every violent outburst must have tactical and relational consequences.
- Keep agency centered: she is never reduced to wound alone.

---

## One-Line Character Thesis
Valerie Wells is what happens when a system tries to engineer obedience and accidentally manufactures an apex survivor who refuses to be owned.
