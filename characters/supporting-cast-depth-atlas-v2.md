## Integration Notes (Room-Level Use)
- Every appearance should either: (a) alter resource access, (b) alter trust map, or (c) alter legitimacy landscape.
- Reuse locked contradictions from canon ledger in dialogue/action, not exposition dumps.
- Maintain “no cartoon villains” rule by granting each antagonist one defensible fear and one indefensible choice.
