# Supporting Cast + Antagonist Lattice v1

_Status: Soft canon scaffold; preserves existing locked names and hierarchy terms_

## Design Principles
- Every supporting character must pressure at least one core character wound.
- Every antagonist must have tactical logic, not cartoon malice.
- Recurring side cast should carry continuity consequences across books.

---

## A) Supporting Cast (Friendly / Ambiguous / Conditional)

## 1) Captain Elias Rourke (EDF Commanding Officer)
- **Role:** Implanted CO with governor-module authority over marine unit.
- **Function:** Human face of the obedience machine and its cracks.
- **Public posture:** Procedure and mission continuity above all.
- **Private fracture:** Knows expendability doctrine is morally untenable; occasionally leaks agency downward.
- **Primary tie:** John Hale (debt history: Hale saved him previously).
- **Turning Point Use:** grants channel access in private, later forced into complicity decisions.

## 2) Warrant Pilot Nadiya Kade
- **Role:** Flight operations mentor/contact who recognizes Valerie’s ceiling.
- **Function:** Tests whether institutional advancement can happen without self-erasure.
- **Alignment:** Conditional ally; helps when outcomes are measurable and defensible.
- **Primary tie:** Valerie Wells.
- **Continuity hook:** preserves or destroys Valerie’s path back to pilot authority.

## 3) Surgeon-Lieutenant Tomas Ilyin
- **Role:** Medical officer managing enhancement side-effects and trauma triage.
- **Function:** Brings physiological truth that command propaganda minimizes.
- **Alignment:** Quietly humanist; risk-averse but not cowardly.
- **Primary ties:** Valerie (endocrine management), Lin (stress load), Hale (moral injury signs).
- **Continuity hook:** keeps sealed records that could expose class-tier medicine inequities.

## 4) Quartermaster Juno Pike
- **Role:** Logistics node for ammunition, replacement parts, and undocumented swaps.
- **Function:** Shows how survival depends on shadow logistics beneath official channels.
- **Alignment:** Transactional ally; loyalty earned via consistency.
- **Primary ties:** Marko + Isaac.
- **Continuity hook:** can route restricted hardware that enables key mission pivots.

## 5) Belt Broker Tamsin Roe
- **Role:** Civilian intermediary across miner enclaves and free ports.
- **Function:** Gives squad non-Earth social intelligence and consequence visibility.
- **Alignment:** Cooperative when respected; hostile if treated like a tool.
- **Primary ties:** Hale + Lin.
- **Continuity hook:** controls introductions that decide whether squad is sheltered or sold out.

## 6) The Brother-Figure (Name intentionally withheld pending reveal lock)
- **Role:** Valerie’s covert inside source in steward-linked infrastructure.
- **Function:** Emotional detonation and strategic data conduit.
- **Alignment:** High loyalty to Valerie, unstable survivability due to self-hacked link.
- **Continuity hook:** ticking-clock neural degradation and exposure risk.

## B) Antagonist Lattice (Layered Opposition)

## Strategic Tier

### 1) Consensus (Regime AI)
- **Type:** System antagonist.
- **Method:** narrative steering, compliance shaping, optimization theater.
- **Weakness:** deep-reasoning ceiling; predictable control heuristics under novel pressure.
- **Use in story:** felt through constraints, altered intel flow, and distorted incentives rather than monologues.

### 2) Stewards of Earth (DC-centered elite class)
- **Type:** Political antagonist lattice.
- **Method:** rulecraft, privilege capture, doctrinal framing of coercion as safety.
- **Weakness:** insulated worldview + dependence on uncontrollable Belt logistics.
- **Use in story:** conflicting directives, policy whiplash, moral hypocrisy.

## Operational Tier

### 3) Director Cassian Voss (Steward Security Bureau)
- **Role:** Mid-to-high architect of deniable operations and disposal protocols.
- **Function:** Faces the cast with strategic ruthlessness that still obeys rational incentives.
- **Conflict vector:** Hale’s human-priority command ethic.
- **Continuity hook:** repeat “clean-up” orders that prove command planned expendability.

### 4) Commander Mireya Sloan (Discipline Officer)
- **Role:** Doctrine enforcer over marine chains.
- **Function:** Valerie’s institutional antagonist; insists that procedure is morality.
- **Conflict vector:** autonomy vs hierarchy.
- **Continuity hook:** repeatedly blocks Valerie’s advancement until field necessity overturns doctrine.

### 5) Blackframe Unit Lead "Kite"
- **Role:** Field commander of elite black-armor team handling high-value extracts.
- **Function:** Immediate tactical threat and betrayal vector.
- **Conflict vector:** squad survival vs mission secrecy.
- **Continuity hook:** recurring operator who survives early encounter and reappears with escalating countermeasures.

## Human-Environment Tier

### 6) Belt Hardline Cells (fragmented)
- **Role:** Adversarial locals who view EDF squads as occupation force.
- **Function:** Prevents simplistic hero framing; forces accountability for collateral harm.
- **Conflict vector:** mission necessity vs legitimacy.
- **Continuity hook:** same cell may alternate enemy/ally depending on squad behavior.

---

## C) Antagonist Interaction Grid (Who Pressures Whom)
- **Hale** pressured by: Voss (disposability logic), Consensus scripts, Belt moral blowback.
- **Valerie** pressured by: Sloan (discipline doctrine), sexual-power echoes in hierarchy, brother exposure risk.
- **Isaac** pressured by: Consensus surveillance adaptation, Voss counterintelligence sweeps.
- **Marko** pressured by: hardware scarcity, forced link-adjacent interfaces, Blackframe overmatch.
- **Lin** pressured by: multi-front uncertainty, squad conflict externalities, manipulated sensor feeds.

---

## D) Escalation Template Across Books
1. **Book 1:** betrayal at operation layer (Kite / blackframe / disposal order).
2. **Book 2:** policy-layer clampdown (Sloan + Voss constraints tighten).
3. **Book 3:** strategic information war (Consensus legitimacy fractures via evidence).
4. **Book 4+:** open contest for post-Consensus governance legitimacy.
