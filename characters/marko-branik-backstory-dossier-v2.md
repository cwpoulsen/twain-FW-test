# Marko Branik — Backstory Dossier v2 (Causality-First)

## Current Function on Team
Heavy assault + mechanical survivability authority. Marko is the squad’s “physics veto”: if a plan ignores pressure, structure, mass, heat, or maintenance reality, he kills it.

## Formative Incident Chain (Timeline-Linked)
1. **Industrial upbringing around failure-prone machinery (pre-EDF)**  
   - Learned early that neglected systems kill people faster than enemies do.
2. **Link-culture compliance pressure inside family/community**  
   - Saw social reward tied to neural conformity rather than competence.
3. **Branik Link-Clinic Refusal Incident (0112)**  
   - Forced intake attempt becomes identity rupture: he chooses autonomy and accepts social punishment.
4. **Marine pipeline normalization (0130)**  
   - Military structure offers legal shelter for noncompliant outliers, but at cost of coerced risk exposure.
5. **Squad attrition phase (0150)**  
   - Repeated losses harden his “overbuild everything” instinct.
6. **Betrayal/escape (0170)**  
   - Confirms his worldview: command-level plans are optimized for expendability, not survivability.

## Belief Formation (Cause → Belief)
- Neglected machinery casualties → **“Reality doesn’t negotiate.”**
- Neural compliance coercion → **“If they can edit your mind, they own your choices.”**
- Attrition under official doctrine → **“Optimism is a command luxury; pessimism keeps people alive.”**
- Escape from disposal attempt → **“Trust must be mechanically verified, never declared.”**

## Coping Mechanics
- **Primary:** Convert fear into technical action (repair, reinforce, reroute).
- **Secondary:** Aggressive humor and bluntness to preempt emotional vulnerability.
- **Stress tell:** Hyperfocus on tools/hull states when discussions turn emotional.
- **Maladaptive edge:** Uses intimidation to force decisions, sometimes flattening nuance.

## Arc Pressure Points
- **B1 pressure:** Mechanical foresight keeps team alive, but social abrasiveness fractures trust.
- **B2 pressure:** Forced link-adjacent interface (see arc scaffold) reactivates 0112 trauma and risks panic-induced mission error.
- **B3 pressure:** Must choose patience and distributed planning over immediate force-projection dominance.

## Team Thematic Identity Contribution
Marko embodies the series theme that autonomy is material, not abstract: freedom requires control over the systems that keep bodies alive.

## Continuity Hooks to Use in Scenes
- Marko checks pressure seals before arguments finish.
- He predicts failures one scene before they happen.
- Link-heavy elites trigger disproportionate hostility unless trust is proven by action.
