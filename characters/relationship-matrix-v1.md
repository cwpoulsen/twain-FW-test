## Core Squad Matrix

| Pair | Current Trust | Current Friction | Core Dynamic | Turning Point Trigger | Arc Direction |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| John Hale <-> Valerie Wells | 3 | 3 | Mutual respect; trauma-informed distance | Mission where one must cede control to the other | Slow-burn toward 5 trust / 2 friction |
| John Hale <-> Isaac Beckham | 4 | 2 | Leader + ghost-operator pragmatism | Isaac withholds critical intel for safety hedge | Trust dip then stronger explicit doctrine |
| John Hale <-> Marko Branik | 4 | 3 | Shared protectiveness, different style | Marko openly challenges command choice in front of unit | Stabilizes at high-trust candid partnership |
| John Hale <-> Lindsay Veil | 5 | 2 | She sees patterns, he acts decisively | Lin’s delayed warning due to harmony-seeking | Evolves into boundary-respecting tactical duet |
| Valerie Wells <-> Isaac Beckham | 2 | 3 | Competence respect, motive skepticism | Isaac route forces Valerie to trust unseen logic | Climbs to practical trust 4 |
| Valerie Wells <-> Marko Branik | 3 | 2 | Directness compatibility; protective aggression overlap | Joint close-quarters crisis | Strong battlefield sibling energy |
| Valerie Wells <-> Lindsay Veil | 3 | 2 | Lin softens edges; Valerie protects Lin physically | Emotional overload incident during pursuit | Trust rises; Lin learns firmer boundary setting |
| Isaac Beckham <-> Marko Branik | 4 | 2 | Software/mechanical co-creation loop | Catastrophic systems failure they solve together | Becomes series-defining technical duo |
| Isaac Beckham <-> Lindsay Veil | 3 | 2 | Intuition + data model complement | Lin override contradicts Isaac probabilities but proves right | Mutual-method respect deepens |
| Marko Branik <-> Lindsay Veil | 4 | 2 | Bruiser shield + empathic navigator | Lin calls out Marko escalation risk mid-op | Friction spike then healthier restraint pattern |

## Core-to-Supporting / Antagonist High-Value Links

| Relationship | Nature | Immediate Story Utility | Long Arc Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hale <-> Capt. Rourke | Debt-bound command tension | Access leaks, selective protection | Rourke forced to choose loyalty: system vs men |
| Valerie <-> Cmdr. Sloan | Institutional adversarial | Tests discipline under provocation | Defines whether Valerie can hold power without surrender |
| Valerie <-> Brother-Figure | Buried family bond | Reveal detonator + rescue conflict | Converts rage into strategic purpose |
| Isaac <-> Director Voss | Hunter vs counter-hunter | Cyber cat-and-mouse escalation | Truth ledger race: expose first or disappear |
| Marko <-> Quartermaster Pike | Resource exchange | Enables impossible repairs under scarcity | Builds off-ledger infrastructure network |
| Lin <-> Broker Tamsin Roe | Trust-dependent diplomacy | Entry to Belt communities | Determines squad legitimacy off Earth |
| Squad <-> Blackframe "Kite" | Tactical nemesis | Action pressure + betrayal memory | Recurring adaptive adversary with personal score |

## Relationship Turning-Point Queue (Recommended Ordering)
1. Hale/Valerie: first explicit trust handoff under fire.
2. Isaac/Marko: joint salvage success that saves all five.
3. Lin/Hale: disagreement where Hale follows Lin’s read against doctrine.
4. Valerie/Sloan: forced procedural cooperation without humiliation.
5. Valerie/Brother reveal: mission-vs-person choice.
6. Hale/Rourke: private truth disclosure that cannot be publicly acknowledged.

## Continuity Rules
- Any major relationship shift must be tied to a concrete mission event, not abstract dialogue alone.
- Trust gains should include future behavioral evidence (changed delegation, changed risk assignment).
- Friction reductions must never erase core personality differences; they should improve handling, not homogenize voices.
