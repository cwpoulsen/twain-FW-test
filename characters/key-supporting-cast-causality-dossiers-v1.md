# Key Supporting Cast — Causality Dossiers v1

Purpose: tie support/antagonist behavior directly to the squad’s thematic identity and operational pressure.

---

## 1) Captain Elias Rourke (Institutional Fracture Ally)

### Current Function
Command-layer pressure valve: he is the human hinge between doctrine and survivability.

### Formative Causality
- Career advancement through procedural excellence during **Managed Innovation Plateau (0080)** taught him that compliance is rewarded faster than truth.
- Begins private mortality correlation archive during **Rourke Attrition Ledger Archive (0132)**.
- Exposure to **Hale Squad Attrition Phase (0150)** converts abstract concern into moral certainty.

### Belief + Coping
- Belief: “If I lose my post, I lose any ability to protect anyone.”
- Coping: compartmentalized double-bookkeeping (official brief vs private ledger).

### Arc Pressure Point
At 0170-class events he must choose whether deniable help is still help if it arrives late.

### Timeline Links
`0080`, `0132`, `0150`, `0170`.

## 2) Quartermaster Juno Pike (Shadow Logistics Spine)

### Current Function
Resource realism enforcer: converts impossible plans into barely survivable plans.

### Formative Causality
- Witnessed preventable deaths from “inventory clean but shelf empty” fraud during transition years.
- Builds deniable routing mesh in **Pike Ghost-Inventory Network Buildout (0142)**.
- Her caches shape survival odds in betrayal corridors linked to **0170** and adaptation phase **0190**.

### Belief + Coping
- Belief: “Morality without supply is theater.”
- Coping: transactional distance; trust expressed as timely delivery, never speeches.

### Arc Pressure Point
Evidence release threatens her channels; helping the squad may collapse the same network that keeps civilians alive.

### Timeline Links
`0142`, `0170`, `0190`.

## 3) Surgeon-Lieutenant Tomas Ilyin (Biopolitical Witness)

### Current Function
Embodied-cost truth source: tracks what enhancement/coercion systems do to actual bodies.

### Formative Causality
- Trained under euphemistic policy language during **Official Euphemism Lexicon Adoption (0095)** era.
- Encounters increasing endocrine/trauma burdens as coercive pipeline normalizes under **0130**.
- Treats post-op fallout through attrition wave **0150**, seeing policy translated into injury patterns.

### Belief + Coping
- Belief: “If it isn’t charted, it didn’t happen politically.”
- Coping: meticulous records, delayed disclosure, selective courage.

### Arc Pressure Point
Must decide when patient protection requires breaking institutional confidentiality.

### Timeline Links
`0095`, `0130`, `0150`, `0190`.

## 4) Director Cassian Voss (Strategic Narrative Antagonist)

### Current Function
Legitimacy warfare architect: ensures truth arrives too late to matter.

### Formative Causality
- Rises during **Rival AGI Suppression Era (0060)** by demonstrating control-through-simplification.
- Codifies narrative preemption in **Voss Disinformation Prebunk Protocol (0152)**.
- Uses betrayal outcomes (**0170**) as test case for disposal plus reputational sterilization.

### Belief + Coping
- Belief: “Predictable cruelty prevents chaotic collapse.”
- Coping: moral outsourcing to models/metrics; personal distance from field consequences.

### Arc Pressure Point
Distributed witness-chain protocols (0145) erode his speed advantage; he must escalate from spin to direct suppression.

### Timeline Links
`0060`, `0145`, `0152`, `0170`.

## 5) Blackframe Lead “Kite” (Operational Nemesis)

### Current Function
Embodied betrayal memory: tactical hunter who forces the squad to evolve.

### Formative Causality
- Career made in deniable high-value extraction doctrine.
- Refines kill-box geometry in **Kite Terminal Capture Drills (0158)**.
- Executes betrayal geometry in **0170**, then adapts against squad counter-patterning in **0190**.

### Belief + Coping
- Belief: “Outcomes absolve method.”
- Coping: professional myth maintenance; suppresses doubt through ritualized readiness.

### Arc Pressure Point
Repeated failure against adaptive targets threatens identity as inevitable finisher.

### Timeline Links
`0158`, `0170`, `0190`.

## 6) Brother-Figure Source (Valerie’s Personal-Strategic Fuse)

### Current Function
High-value inside conduit whose existence weaponizes Valerie’s unresolved trust wound.

### Formative Causality
- Shared formative household bond with Valerie creates protection covenant.
- Survives inside steward infrastructure through self-compromise as surveillance tightens (linked to `0060`/`0152` logic).
- Ghost signals during/after **0170** seed reveal arc that detonates in B2 scaffolds.

### Belief + Coping
- Belief: “Redemption must be useful, not confessed.”
- Coping: secrecy, compartmentalized self-harm, delayed truth.

### Arc Pressure Point
If identity confirms under countdown pressure, Valerie must choose mission continuity or personal rescue.

### Timeline Links
`0060`, `0122`, `0152`, `0170`, B2-S09/B2-S10.

## Thematic Fit Check (Support Cast → Core Team Theme)
- **Autonomy vs control:** Rourke, Voss, Kite each represent different control logics.
- **Truth vs narrative:** Isaac/Ilyin/Rourke/Pike networks define whether evidence survives.
- **Care vs coercion:** Valerie’s source line and Lin-facing civilian intermediaries test whether protection can exist without ownership.

## Cross-Book Character Decision Ripple Ledger (Pass 2 Lock)

### Rourke
- **Book 1–2 decision:** covertly help without openly defecting.
- **Cost:** aid arrives late/incomplete; squad suffers avoidable losses of trust and opportunity.
- **Ripple:** by Book 3 his partial complicity is exploitable propaganda; by Book 4 he can broker transition only if he accepts public accountability.

### Pike
- **Book 2 decision:** prioritize civilian survivability channels over squad-exclusive loyalty.
- **Cost:** mission windows close when she withholds routes too risky for habitat populations.
- **Ripple:** by Book 3 her network is thinner and more surveilled; by Book 4 she becomes essential to ration legitimacy debates.

### Ilyin
- **Book 2/3 decision:** leak medically grounded coercion evidence.
- **Cost:** immediate patient confidentiality breach fallout and retaliatory targeting.
- **Ripple:** by Book 3 evidence credibility rises, but by Book 4 tribunals must adjudicate tainted-but-necessary disclosures.

### Voss
- **Book 3 decision:** escalate from narrative management to direct suppression.
- **Cost:** short-term control gains but permanent loss of plausible procedural legitimacy.
- **Ripple:** by Book 4 moderates inside steward institutions defect or stonewall, accelerating regime fragmentation.

### Kite
- **Book 2/3 decision:** adapt tactics toward increasingly total kill-boxes against squad analogs.
- **Cost:** collateral exposure increases, undermining myth of clean precision.
- **Ripple:** by Book 4 anti-Blackframe sentiment constrains any successor state’s deniable-force doctrine.

### Brother-Figure Source
- **Book 2 decision:** reveal identity and provide actionable intelligence under countdown pressure.
- **Cost:** burns long-cultivated cover; triggers personal and strategic retaliation.
- **Ripple:** by Book 3 his survival or loss reconfigures Valerie’s command style; by Book 4 his disclosures force reconciliation of justice vs reconciliation politics.
