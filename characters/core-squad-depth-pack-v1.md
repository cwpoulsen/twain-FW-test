# Core Squad Depth Pack v1

_Status: Soft canon scaffold (compatible with current locked bios)_

Continuity note: formative events should reference `timeline/master-timeline-sequence-v1.md` indices (especially 0100, 0120, 0150, 0170, 0180) to prevent drift across character files.

## Squad Core (Current Known Five)
- Staff Sergeant **John Hale** — squad lead; triage-first protector doctrine and moral center under compression.
- Corporal **Valerie Wells** — strike pilot/close-quarters apex operator; autonomy-first with rage on a leash.
- Specialist **Isaac Beckham** — exploit engineer; protocol-chain intrusions, telemetry forensics, covert access.
- Specialist **Marko Branik** — breach/mechanical bruiser; blunt truth, hard-systems intuition, pressure-hull pragmatist.
- Private **Lindsay "Lin" Veil** — sensor and astrogation pattern-reader; empathy-forward early-warning asset.

## 1) Staff Sergeant John Hale — Deepening Layer

### Hidden Contradiction
- Publicly enforces discipline to keep people alive.
- Privately believes strict obedience is what killed his family and keeps repeating itself.

### Tactical Decision Pattern
1. Stabilize immediate casualties (tourniquet/airway/pressure integrity in first 90 seconds).
2. Preserve maneuver space for extraction (always keep one unjammed corridor and one fallback seal-door).
3. Accept personal risk before assigning risk down-chain (he takes point on blind corners and boarding collars).
4. Delay irreversible moral compromise if any alternative exists (prefers capture/isolation over execution when timeline permits).

### Book-Turn Anchors
- **Turn A (Book 1, ~35%):** Databank raid moral injury confirms that tactical correctness can still be moral failure.
- **Turn B (Book 1, ~70%):** learns squad was always expendable in command plan; shifts from compliance to conditional obedience.
- **Turn C (Book 2):** first deliberate disobedience to protect civilians and squad simultaneously.

### Continuity Hooks
- Sister search objective should keep surfacing in low-visibility channels and recovered records.
- His “acceptable loss = zero” internal doctrine must repeatedly collide with strategic reality.

---

## 2) Corporal Valerie Wells — Deepening Layer

### Hidden Contradiction
- Craves cockpit-level control.
- Still operates from trauma-era assumptions that all authority proximity is predatory.

### Tactical Decision Pattern
1. Scan power dynamics in room before mission details (who controls doors, comms mute rights, and flight authorization).
2. If coercion signal appears, assume bad faith until disproven; she pre-briefs an extraction vector before debate starts.
3. Under direct threat, uses extreme violence cleanly and fast (center-mass burst, mobility kill, move).
4. Post-event, reasserts procedural precision (checklist callouts, throttle discipline, weapons safing) to keep rage from driving second-order mistakes.

### Book-Turn Anchors
- **Turn A (Book 1, ~25%):** chooses restraint in a trigger scenario, proving discipline is a weapon.
- **Turn B (Book 1, ~80%):** ambiguous brother-figure signal appears during mission-critical burn window; credibility seed only, no full confirmation.
- **Turn C (Book 2):** full reveal + mission-vs-relationship split decision; later returns to pilot authority under explicit consent/protocol terms she negotiates.

### Continuity Hooks
- Brother reveal breadcrumbs must predate full reveal by multiple operational anomalies.
- Fertility side-effect should appear as lived emotional cost, not exposition reveal-only beat.

---

## 3) Specialist Isaac Beckham — Deepening Layer

### Hidden Contradiction
- Systems-level confidence is extreme.
- Human trust tolerance is low; he over-relies on solvable-machine framing for unsolved emotional realities.

### Tactical Decision Pattern
1. Find the weakest protocol edge, not strongest wall (maintenance APIs, deprecated certs, human override forms).
2. Chain low-grade vulnerabilities into high-value outcomes (telemetry spoof -> queue access -> release-key observation).
3. Keep one shadow route unshared in case command channel is compromised (dead-drop key shard + delayed beacon).
4. Burn identity traces only when exfil route exists; never erase evidence that could prove command tampering.

### Book-Turn Anchors
- **Turn A (Book 1, ~40%):** recognizes command telemetry manipulation and silently starts parallel logs.
- **Turn B (Book 2 midpoint):** must choose between preserving covert access persistence vs exposing truth immediately to save lives.
- **Turn C (Book 3):** transitions from ghost operator to mission-planning co-author (social trust growth).

### Continuity Hooks
- Isaac/Marko co-lead loop should power ship survivability gains across books.
- His archived “truth ledger” can become key proof against Consensus narratives.

---

## 4) Specialist Marko Branik — Deepening Layer

### Hidden Contradiction
- Performs as fearless blunt instrument.
- Secretly terrified of cognitive capture; anger masks fear of losing inner autonomy.

### Tactical Decision Pattern
1. Physically secure survivability first (hull, pressure, power, doors).
2. Refuse plans built on optimistic assumptions.
3. Use aggression to break paralysis when team stalls.
4. Protect weaker teammates through proximity and force projection.

### Book-Turn Anchors
- **Turn A (Book 1, ~50%):** salvages mission from mechanical collapse, earns de facto engineering authority.
- **Turn B (Book 2, ~60%):** forced temporary link-interface contact; panic response nearly compromises op.
- **Turn C (Book 3):** chooses strategic patience over immediate force, marking maturation.

### Continuity Hooks
- His disdain for neural-link culture should sharpen conflict with implanted elites and softened collaborators.
- Mechanical foresight scenes should foreshadow later failures before they occur.

---

## 5) Private Lindsay "Lin" Veil — Deepening Layer

### Hidden Contradiction
- Wants everyone emotionally stable and connected.
- Her harmony-seeking can delay critical conflict and increase eventual blast radius.

### Tactical Decision Pattern
1. Detect vector anomalies and pattern drift early.
2. Offer route alternatives with confidence bands.
3. Suppress personal distress to avoid burdening team.
4. Eventually overload if interpersonal conflict remains unresolved.

### Book-Turn Anchors
- **Turn A (Book 1, ~30%):** identifies a trap nobody else can see; saves unit.
- **Turn B (Book 2 midpoint):** withholds concern to keep peace, causing near-failure.
- **Turn C (Book 2 climax):** asserts boundary + truth early, preventing catastrophic ambush.

### Continuity Hooks
- Hale/Veil pairing (she sees, he acts) should recur as a recognizable tactical signature.
- Her arc must visibly move from emotional fusion to compassionate boundaries.

## Squad-Level Emotional Engine (Cross-Character)

### Shared Fear
- Being treated as expendable kit by command layers that never enter the blast radius.

### Shared Need
- Build a self-authored fireteam ethic inside coercive institutions and keep it intact under stress.

### Shared Tactical Evolution
1. **Book 1:** survive betrayal.
2. **Book 2:** establish independent operational doctrine.
3. **Book 3+:** transition from hunted survivors to selective strategic actors.

### Recurring Continuity Device
- After each major operation, include a short “debrief fracture” beat:
  - what command says happened,
  - what the squad knows happened,
  - what they choose to record publicly vs privately.
