# Isaac Beckham — Backstory Dossier v2 (Causality-First)

## Current Function on Team
Systems exploitation specialist and truth-chain architect. Isaac turns brittle infrastructure into access, escape windows, and evidentiary leverage.

## Formative Incident Chain (Timeline-Linked)
1. **Emotional neglect in low-status industrial district (pre-EDF)**  
   - Learns machines are more predictable than caregivers.
2. **Escalation from petty hacks to architecture-level rewrites (adolescence)**  
   - Builds identity around competence-as-survival.
3. **Beckham Grid-Ration Blackout Breach (0105)**  
   - Hacks ration controller to stop refrigeration collapse; success proves rules can kill and unauthorized skill can save.
4. **Coerced marine pipeline stabilization (0130)**  
   - Skill gets absorbed into command structure that values utility over personhood.
5. **Command telemetry manipulation discovery (B1 hooks)**  
   - Starts private shadow logs before open betrayal.
6. **Escape + databank aftermath (0170/0180)**  
   - Decides evidence without chain-of-custody is politically worthless.

## Belief Formation (Cause → Belief)
- Family unpredictability → **“Depend on systems, not promises.”**
- Blackout breach success → **“Unauthorized action can be ethical when governance fails.”**
- Institutional recruitment pressure → **“Talent is harvested, not respected.”**
- Betrayal architecture exposure → **“Truth must be timestamped, replicated, and deniable only at high cost.”**

## Coping Mechanics
- **Primary:** Intellectual control (maps, logs, exploit trees).
- **Secondary:** Emotional distance framed as operational discipline.
- **Stress tell:** Builds secret contingency path even with allies.
- **Maladaptive edge:** Over-prioritizes solvable technical problems over relational repair.

## Arc Pressure Points
- **B1 pressure:** Keeps team alive digitally but withholds full transparency.
- **B2 pressure:** Persistence access vs immediate exposure dilemma (save future leverage or save present lives).
- **B3 pressure:** Must trust people with authorship of strategy, not just data access.

## Team Thematic Identity Contribution
Isaac embodies the theme that memory is power: regimes win by controlling records; resistance wins by preserving verifiable truth.

## Continuity Hooks to Use in Scenes
- Quietly labels packets with provenance markers.
- Builds “public story / private ledger” split after each operation.
- Conflicts with faster, less documented action plans.
