## PT-01 — Hale vs Valerie: Command Restraint Under Kin-Target Signal

### Setup
During a mid-Book-2 exfiltration window, ISR confirms a hostile coordination node linked to Valerie’s brother-adjacent network signatures. Timing pressure implies they can strike now or lose the target for months.

### Fault Line
- Hale prioritizes chain-of-proof and long campaign viability as a free-operator coalition lead, not as EDF command.
- Valerie prioritizes immediate disruption and personal accountability.

### Decision Fork
A) Strike immediately with incomplete positive identification.  
B) Delay for confirmation, risking civilian escape corridor compromise.

### Immediate Cost
- A: potential fratricide/moral catastrophe.
- B: tactical loss and emotional rupture with Valerie.

### Long-Tail Consequence
- A may accelerate team mistrust and fracture coalition credibility.
- B may preserve legitimacy but deepen Valerie’s suppressed rage, affecting later command reliability.

### Canon Checks
- Valerie restraint arc must evolve, not reset.
- Evidence integrity remains strategic asset.
- No instant revelation that resolves brother-thread prematurely.

## PT-02 — Isaac vs Marko: Security Through Transparency or Compartmentalization

### Setup
In Book 3, Isaac proposes wider telemetry sharing with allied cells to crowdsource authenticity validation. Marko argues leaks will get people killed.

### Fault Line
- Isaac: trust architecture builds resilience.
- Marko: exposure multiplies attack surface.

### Decision Fork
A) Open partial data lake to allied nodes.  
B) Keep strict compartmentalization and central review.

### Immediate Cost
- A: infiltration risk rises.
- B: authenticity lag erodes political impact.

### Long-Tail Consequence
- A can strengthen coalition intelligence culture if defended well.
- B can produce “elite gatekeeper” resentment mirroring regime behavior.

### Canon Checks
- Consensus is strongest in institutions; coalition must avoid cloning opaque monopoly habits.
- Information war outcomes must respect comms delay and verification friction.

---

## PT-03 — Lin vs Hale: Humanitarian Corridor vs Strategic Interdiction

### Setup
Book 7 chokepoint campaign. A mixed convoy requests emergency passage through a contested lane likely carrying dual-use components.

### Fault Line
- Lin argues denying passage creates preventable civilian suffering and propaganda disaster.
- Hale argues allowing passage may sustain adversary operations.

### Decision Fork
A) Full deny and seize.  
B) Conditional passage with invasive inspection and delayed clearance.

### Immediate Cost
- A: humanitarian backlash and reputational damage.
- B: increased operational risk and possible adversary exploitation.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Choice shapes coalition’s lane-governance legitimacy entering Earth approach ops.

### Canon Checks
- Transit/chokepoint realism must remain explicit.
- Tactical win must carry moral/strategic cost.

---

## PT-04 — Valerie vs Isaac: AI Seed Access Escalation

### Setup
A catastrophic systems outage hits allied habitats. Emergency analysts claim the boxed seed could optimize recovery decisions if access level is raised.

### Fault Line
- Valerie: pragmatic urgency under mass-casualty threat.
- Isaac: warns that procedural breach destroys governance credibility and containment trust.

### Decision Fork
A) Emergency unilateral escalation.  
B) Keep multi-key process despite probable deaths from delay.

### Immediate Cost
- A: procedural taboo broken.
- B: people die while council deliberates.

### Long-Tail Consequence
A sets precedent for future power grabs; B fuels narrative of technocratic cruelty.

### Canon Checks
- Seed remains governance/custody problem.
- No depiction of seed as magical instant fixer.

---

## PT-05 — Marko vs Valerie: Revenge Opportunity During Withdrawal

### Setup
Post-operation retreat in Book 4. A captured officer responsible for governor-module abuse is in reach, but extraction bandwidth is critically limited.

### Fault Line
- Marko: keep prisoner for testimony and legal process.
- Valerie: argues field justice for irreversible harms.

### Decision Fork
A) Execute in field.  
B) Preserve for tribunal transfer.

### Immediate Cost
- A: emotional release but legal and strategic damage.
- B: higher exfiltration risk and survivor rage backlash.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Determines whether coalition justice appears principled or opportunistic.

### Canon Checks
- Transitional justice themes must begin before formal transition era.
- Character growth should change tactical choices.

---

## PT-06 — Hale vs Lin: Truth Release Timing

### Setup
Book 3 proof packet can expose SACT legal manipulation. Releasing now could derail active ceasefire talks.

### Fault Line
- Hale: delay release to preserve negotiation channel.
- Lin: delay rewards impunity and erases victim trust.

### Decision Fork
A) Release immediately.  
B) Stage release after ceasefire framework.

### Immediate Cost
- A: talks collapse.
- B: internal legitimacy and morale strain.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Choice influences whether coalition is seen as principled reformer or cynical power seeker.

### Canon Checks
- Must keep record-integrity warfare central.
- No simple “truth always wins instantly” framing.

---

## PT-07 — Team vs Team: Debt Call-In From BMAX Ally

### Setup
A Belt aid node that sheltered Blackfly in Book 2 calls in a debt during Book 6 industrial contest, requesting protection for a questionable smuggling route.

### Fault Line
- Reciprocity ethics vs anti-corruption standards.

### Decision Fork
A) Honor debt unconditionally.  
B) Condition support on transparent route audit.

### Immediate Cost
- A: mission drift and standards erosion.
- B: alliance fracture risk.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Defines whether coalition networks become principled institutions or patronage webs.

### Canon Checks
- Alliance politics should remain transactional but evolvable.
- Institutional maturation is a core mid-arc requirement.

---

## PT-08 — Isaac and Lin: Deepfake Countermeasure Ethics

### Setup
Hostile media operation deploys synthetic casualty footage blaming coalition forces. Isaac can deploy an aggressive counter-campaign using manipulated captures to expose adversary hypocrisy.

### Fault Line
- Isaac: counter-force to neutralize disinfo surge.
- Lin: means contaminate ends and will poison long-term trust.

### Decision Fork
A) Deploy manipulative but effective counter-content.  
B) Stick to slower verified rebuttal path.

### Immediate Cost
- A: short-term narrative recovery with ethical breach.
- B: immediate outrage spike and potential unrest.

### Long-Tail Consequence
A undermines CSTN-style trust architecture; B may cost lives but preserve legitimacy foundations.

### Canon Checks
- Coalition must not become mirror disinformation state.

---

## PT-09 — Hale vs Marko: Demobilization Priority in Active Theater

### Setup
Late Book 9, resources can either rotate exhausted coerced veterans into recovery programs or sustain peak combat readiness for final Earth seizure corridors.

### Fault Line
- Hale: strategic window demands tempo.
- Marko: burned soldiers become future instability and moral failure.

### Decision Fork
A) Delay demobilization.  
B) Accept temporary combat slowdown.

### Immediate Cost
- A: force effectiveness now, social bomb later.
- B: tactical vulnerability now, better postwar stability.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Choice directly shapes Book 10 relapse risk.

### Canon Checks
- Reconquest must be gradual and governance-sensitive.

---

## PT-10 — Valerie and Lin: Survivor Testimony Protection

### Setup
A key witness can expose CSVD abuses but requests anonymity protections that weaken courtroom impact.

### Fault Line
- Valerie: prioritize witness safety absolutely.
- Lin: public accountability may require visible testimony.

### Decision Fork
A) Shield identity, reduce evidentiary force.  
B) Encourage public testimony with security package.

### Immediate Cost
- A: legal case fragile.
- B: elevated assassination risk.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Establishes coalition precedent for balancing truth and care.

### Canon Checks
- Transitional justice must remain costly and imperfect.

---

## PT-11 — Isaac vs Hale: Class 2 Queue Manipulation for Strategic Gain

### Setup
Coalition gains temporary covert access to legacy SFAB scheduler controls. Isaac can divert Class 2 outputs to coalition clinics and comms.

### Fault Line
- Isaac: corrective reallocation from unjust system.
- Hale: hidden manipulation undermines anti-monopoly credibility.

### Decision Fork
A) Covertly reroute for urgent needs.  
B) Expose exploit publicly and refuse covert use.

### Immediate Cost
- A: saves lives now, corruption precedent later.
- B: avoids precedent, sacrifices immediate humanitarian upside.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Determines whether coalition governance relies on secret levers or transparent compacts.

### Canon Checks
- Tactical wins must have strategic moral costs.
- Institution redesign, not merely capture, is required.

---

## PT-12 — Group Pressure Test: The “Necessary Monster” Proposal

### Setup
Book 8 coalition summit. A senior strategist proposes temporary centralized emergency board with broad surveillance powers to win reconquest quickly.

### Fault Line
All core characters split differently:
- Hale sees short-term necessity risk.
- Valerie fears abuse but wants decisive action.
- Isaac opposes concentration absent hard technical constraints.
- Marko distrusts abstract promises without enforcement.
- Lin prioritizes human rights floor and sunset mechanics.

### Decision Fork
A) Approve board with weak safeguards.  
B) Reject board and accept slower campaign.

### Immediate Cost
- A: operational speed with constitutional danger.
- B: coalition fragmentation risk and battlefield losses.

### Long-Tail Consequence
This is a prefiguration of Book 10 constitutional endgame.

### Canon Checks
- Anti-relapse architecture must be explicit, not assumed.

---

## PT-13 — Hale and Valerie: SACT Judge Capture Opportunity

### Setup
An insider offers to blackmail a SACT judge into issuing rulings favorable to coalition detainee protections.

### Fault Line
- Hale: unlawful manipulation corrodes transition justice.
- Valerie: using dirty tools to stop current harm may be justified.

### Decision Fork
A) Proceed with coercive leverage.  
B) Decline and pursue slower legal exposure route.

### Immediate Cost
- A: immediate wins, legitimacy contamination.
- B: detainees remain at risk longer.

### Long-Tail Consequence
A can delegitimize all future SACT reforms; B may cost lives but preserve process credibility.

### Canon Checks
- Legal theater critique should not imply legal nihilism.

---

## PT-14 — Isaac and Marko: Fabricator Evacuation Triage

### Setup
During a raid, transport capacity allows extraction of either key technicians or their families, not both.

### Fault Line
- Isaac: technicians are strategic bottleneck.
- Marko: abandoning families is moral collapse and future trust failure.

### Decision Fork
A) Extract technicians first.  
B) Split extraction, risking mission failure.

### Immediate Cost
- A: preserves throughput potential, damages coalition moral standing.
- B: lower immediate strategic gain, higher survival uncertainty.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Impacts recruitment willingness among critical specialists across Books 6-8.

### Canon Checks
- Class path stakes must remain human, not abstract industrial numbers.

---

## PT-15 — Lin vs Team: Memory and Mercy in Book 10 Hearings

### Setup
A mid-level OCC administrator who enabled coercive shortages requests restorative pathway, claiming hidden acts that saved thousands.

### Fault Line
- Lin: mixed culpability requires nuanced justice.
- Others: fear setting precedent for elite excuse-making.

### Decision Fork
A) Offer conditional restoration route with full disclosure.
B) Pursue punitive precedent to signal zero tolerance.

### Immediate Cost
- A: public anger from victims’ blocs.
- B: loss of institutional memory and possible bureaucratic non-cooperation.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Signals whether new order values vengeance, accountability, or pragmatic reconciliation.

### Canon Checks
- Post-victory governance fragility must be foregrounded.

---

## PT-16 — Team Split: Hide Pattern vs Mission Tempo Under Dragnet Uncertainty

### Setup
After Blackfly escape signature washout, adversaries broaden system dragnet tactics (informers, docking audits, false bounties) without confirmed position data. A time-sensitive rescue request arrives from a prior ally.

### Fault Line
- One side argues reduced movement and signature discipline to avoid probabilistic capture.
- The other argues rapid intervention to preserve alliance credibility before the net tightens.

### Decision Fork
A) Prioritize concealment cycle and delay rescue.  
B) Move fast, accepting higher detectability through indirect network traces.

### Immediate Cost
- A: ally loss and reputational erosion.
- B: legal/exposure trail growth that may compromise future mobility.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Defines whether Blackfly remains strategically elusive or becomes progressively localizable through cumulative metadata and social debt.

### Canon Checks
- Enemy awareness = missing asset, unknown current position.
- Pressure is systemic and probabilistic, not omniscient direct tracking.

---

## PT-17 — Valerie vs Lin: Warform Mercy Threshold

### Setup
During a boarding action, the team confirms enemy assault units are fully overridden human warforms linked to a remote processor node. A narrow window exists to disable uplink, but not before imminent threat to civilians.

### Fault Line
- Valerie argues immediate body-stop force to prevent civilian deaths.
- Lin argues short-delay gambit to sever control first and reduce irreversible harm to overridden bodies.

### Decision Fork
A) Immediate lethal neutralization.  
B) Attempt uplink sever under higher short-term risk.

### Immediate Cost
- A: civilian protection now with severe moral injury load.
- B: higher tactical danger and possible casualties if sever attempt fails.

### Long-Tail Consequence
Choice sets coalition precedent for whether human-puppet enemies are treated primarily as persons-to-rescue, platforms-to-disable, or hazards-to-destroy under time pressure.

### Canon Checks
- Fully overridden units should not be depicted with intact personal agency.
- ROE should prioritize control-disruption when feasible, without denying urgent self-defense realities.

## Dialogue Calibration Notes

To avoid repetitive conflict scenes:
1. Vary argument language by character value system:
   - Hale: burden, stewardship, second-order effects.
   - Valerie: loyalty, harm memory, protective rage.
   - Isaac: systems integrity, verification, attack surface.
   - Marko: survivability, trust earned in blood, practical consequences.
   - Lin: dignity floor, relational truth, long-term human cost.
2. Ensure at least one participant reframes problem rather than just opposes.
3. Resolve scenes with actionable next step, not pure emotional stalemate.

---

## Continuity Safeguards

- No pressure test should require physics-breaking movement or real-time omniscience.
- Any scene using institutions should reference at least one documented process appendix.
- AI seed disputes should remain about authority, safety, and legitimacy before capability.
- Asterion League remains coalition framework with internal tension, not monolith.
- Every successful pressure-test outcome should create a debt payable in a later book.


## Low-G Physical Credibility Addendum (Small Bodies)

Use these rules whenever pressure tests stage action on asteroids/small bodies:

1. Characters must anchor before high-force acts (weapon fire, forced entry, heavy tool work).
2. Direction changes require explicit attitude correction (micro-thrusters, tether pivot, handhold transfer).
3. Recoil always has movement consequences unless counter-braced.
4. Grappling/fighting reads as rotational control and line management, not terrestrial stance fighting.
5. Scene beats should include at least one momentum-management choice that affects tactical outcome.

## Continuity Lock Bundle (Pass 5, compressed)

Hard assumptions for all tests: AI seed acquired in opening spec-op, databank later provides training/provenance data; Blackfly crew remain permanent post-EDF free operators; post-nuke pursuit is probabilistic dragnet under unknown position; full-override warforms are non-conscious remote instruments; FVB instability is intentionally seeded via release patterns; small-body actions require anchoring and attitude control.
