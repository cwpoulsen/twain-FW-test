# Specialist Isaac Beckham — Character Bible v2 (Specificity Pass)

## Snapshot
- **Name:** Isaac Beckham
- **Role:** Systems exploitation lead; provenance-chain and evidentiary integrity specialist
- **Core Hook:** He can open almost anything, but his real weapon is deciding which truth survives sabotage.
- **Status:** Canon-aligned working anchor (pair with `characters/isaac-beckham-backstory-dossier-v2.md`)

---

## Operational Identity

### Primary Mission Utility
- Defeats brittle control stacks (access gates, sensor permissions, scheduler locks, identity fences).
- Builds chain-of-custody architecture so captured data can survive political denial.
- Runs “public story / private ledger” split to preserve leverage across long campaigns.

### Team Interface
- Works closest with Branik in ship adaptation cycles:
  - **Branik:** physical pathways, hardware integration, survivability routing.
  - **Beckham:** firmware, trust logic, exploit sequencing, telemetry forensics.

## Capability Profile

### Strengths
1. **Exploit-chain synthesis** — links weak subsystems into decisive openings.
2. **Forensic discipline** — timestamps, signatures, and replication strategy under pressure.
3. **Low-latency improvisation** — produces viable access paths in collapsing timelines.
4. **Legacy architecture fluency** — excellent at systems built for compliance optics, not adversarial resilience.

### Weaknesses / Failure Modes
1. **Opacity reflex** — withholds intent to retain optionality, damaging trust.
2. **Control bias** — prioritizes solvable technical vectors over messy human repair.
3. **Contingency addiction** — keeps backdoor plans even when collaboration would be better.
4. **Moral overfitting risk** — may justify intrusive action if he believes institutional failure is likely.

## Voice Anchors
- Quiet, exact, and dry; rarely wastes words.
- Talks in architecture (“attack surface,” “signing chain,” “rollback window”) when stressed.
- Uses humor sparingly, usually as understatement after near-failure.

---

## Scene-Usable Behavioral Fingerprints
- Labels evidence packets with provenance tags before anyone asks.
- Never trusts single-source telemetry on first read.
- During planning, asks: “Who can falsify this and how fast?”
- In conflict, defaults to preserving future proof value even at short-term comfort cost.

---

## Arc Spine (Books 1–4)
- **B1:** Saves crew repeatedly through technical precision but erodes trust through secrecy.
- **B2:** Forced choice between keeping persistence access and revealing compromise immediately.
- **B3:** Learns to share strategy authorship rather than acting as private failsafe state.
- **B4:** Evolves from lone exploiter to coalition-grade truth infrastructure architect.

---

## Continuity Constraints
- Preserve acquisition split: AI seed/system secured in opening extraction; databank later provides training/provenance value.
- Keep no-omniscience reality: access is partial, contested, and costly.
- Ensure every major hack leaves consequence trails (counterforensics, retaliation, trust fallout).

## Working Character Thesis
Isaac Beckham embodies the setting’s central information war: not whether truth exists, but whether truth can stay intact long enough to matter.
