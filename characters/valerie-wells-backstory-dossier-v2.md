# Valerie Wells — Backstory Dossier v2 (Causality-First)

## Current Function on Team
Combat precision operator and high-risk pilot authority in formation. Valerie is the squad’s coercion detector and decisive-response engine under time-critical threat.

## Formative Incident Chain (Timeline-Linked)
1. **Servitude childhood in steward households (pre-EDF)**  
   - Body treated as labor asset, not self-owned person.
2. **Second-household brother-figure mentorship**  
   - Learns self-defense and conditional trust via one protected relationship.
3. **Cadet Assault Incident (0120)**  
   - Violent self-defense against officer coercion; survival through immediate force.
4. **Silence Accord Hearing (0122)**  
   - Demotion-for-silence bargain encodes lesson: institutions trade truth for order.
5. **Marine pipeline normalization exposure (0130)**  
   - Career path narrowed to performance-under-control narrative.
6. **Escape betrayal and free-team phase (0170/0190)**  
   - Rewrites authority model around negotiated trust, not rank.

## Belief Formation (Cause → Belief)
- Servitude conditioning → **“If I do not defend my boundary, nobody else will.”**
- Brother-figure care → **“Trust is possible, but only with proven protection behavior.”**
- Assault + board bargain → **“Procedure can hide violence while punishing resistance.”**
- Betrayal op → **“Chain-of-command legitimacy is conditional on survival ethics.”**

## Coping Mechanics
- **Primary:** Procedural precision under stress (checklists, timing, posture control).
- **Secondary:** Hypervigilance to dominance cues in rooms and briefings.
- **Stress tell:** Hands tighten, voice gets clipped, decision horizon narrows.
- **Maladaptive edge:** Preemptive aggression when threat cues are ambiguous.

## Arc Pressure Points
- **B1 pressure:** Must separate justified vigilance from reflex escalation.
- **B2 pressure:** Brother-source reveal collides with mission clock and unresolved betrayal memory.
- **B3 pressure:** Needs command-grade restraint without surrendering autonomy core.

## Team Thematic Identity Contribution
Valerie embodies the theme that discipline can be reclaimed: structure becomes liberating only when chosen, negotiated, and tied to mutual accountability.

## Continuity Hooks to Use in Scenes
- She audits power dynamics before mission details.
- In trigger-adjacent moments, deliberate breath/procedure beats signal growth.
- Authority conflicts are most volatile when truth is withheld “for stability.”
