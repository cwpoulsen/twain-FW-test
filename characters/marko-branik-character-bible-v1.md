# Specialist Marko Branik — Character Bible v2 (Specificity Pass)

## Snapshot
- **Name:** Marko Branik
- **Role:** Breach assault + mechanical survivability lead (Blackfly physical plant co-owner with Beckham)
- **Core Hook:** He is the person who can hold a hatch, rip a pump, and redesign a failure chain before command finishes lying about it.
- **Status:** Canon-aligned working anchor (use with `characters/marko-branik-backstory-dossier-v2.md`)

## Operational Read

### What strangers see in first contact
- 203 cm / 6'8" intimidation footprint, scarred forearms, habitually grease-marked gloves.
- Speaks in verdicts, not hedges.
- Treats briefings as suspect until hardware proves them.

### What the team learns after three missions
- Maintains a private “failure stack” per operation: top five components likely to kill them.
- Tracks mass, pressure, heat, and seal integrity in his head while others debate intent.
- Repairs to survivability standard, not nominal standard; this slows prep but lowers casualty probability.

## Crew Function (Locked)
1. **Breach mass and close-quarters anchor** — first through when corridor geometry favors force.
2. **Mechanical veto authority** — can stop plans that violate pressure/structure/thermal reality.
3. **Damage-control chief** — triages hull, coolant, actuator, and life-support failures under fire.
4. **Ship adaptation partner** — with Beckham: Marko owns physical integration, Beckham owns control/software layer.

## Capability Profile

### Strengths
- **Failure-cascade intuition:** recognizes second-order break patterns quickly.
- **Improvised survivability engineering:** can convert salvage into viable seals, braces, and bypass loops.
- **Fear transfer:** turns team panic into task sequencing via blunt command language.
- **Physical dominance:** short-window decisive violence in constrained spaces.

### Weaknesses / Failure Modes
- **Social collateral damage:** candor can fracture fragile coalition trust.
- **Control aggression:** overrules too early when uncertainty feels political rather than mechanical.
- **Link-trauma trigger (0112):** forced interface environments can spike threat response.
- **Maintenance obsession:** can overinvest in robustness when tempo demands acceptable risk.

---

## Voice + Dialogue Anchors
- Sentence style: short, declarative, tool-first.
- Preferred framing: “What fails first?” “What seals this?” “Who signs the risk?”
- Humor: dark and functional, used to keep hands moving.
- Never speaks in abstract ideology during contact; he speaks in forces, timings, and break points.

---

## Scene-Usable Behavioral Fingerprints
- Checks hatch dogs and pressure gauges mid-argument.
- Redirects moral debate into operational checklists when lives are immediate.
- Refuses “we’ll fix it later” promises unless a part, a window, and an owner are named.
- If command authority is cited, asks for telemetry and signature provenance.

---

## Arc Spine (Books 1–4)
- **B1:** Keeps squad alive through overbuild discipline; alienates allies with contempt for soft assurances.
- **B2:** Forced interface episode reopens autonomy trauma; must operate under partial trust instead of full control.
- **B3:** Learns to distribute survivability knowledge rather than hoard it as personal burden.
- **B4:** Becomes coalition-level reliability symbol: still abrasive, but predictably fair when risk is explicit.

## Working Character Thesis
Marko Branik is the crew’s physical truth function: in a setting built on narrative control, he enforces the one authority no regime can spin—material reality.
