# Specialist Marko Branik — Character Bible v1 (Working)

## Snapshot
- **Name:** Marko Branik
- **Role:** Heavy assault / mechanical savant
- **Core Hook:** A physically overwhelming blunt-force operator with dark humor and zero social filter, hiding genius-level systems intuition and an almost compulsive need to repair what is broken.
- **Status:** Working draft (expand with crew-dynamics pass)

## Core Identity

### Surface Read
- 6'8" mass-and-muscle presence.
- Brutish, confrontational, and openly calls out hypocrisy.
- Speaks bluntly; dark humor under stress.

### True Read
- Savant-grade comprehension of mechanics and complex physical systems.
- Compulsive fixer: cannot leave broken systems alone if repair is possible.
- Chose cognitive autonomy over social conformity tied to neural-link culture.

---

## Origin / Formation (Current Canon)
- American-heritage upbringing with foreign-parent household influence.
- Raised in a neural-link family culture that emphasized hard work and compliance norms.
- Developed early fascination with machinery and mechanical systems.
- Observed neural-link degradation effects on reasoning and refused that path for himself.
- Joined EDF voluntarily, motivated by adventure, agency, and frontier technical challenge.

## Strengths (Locked for now)
1. **Mechanical Savant Processing** — exceptional intuitive understanding of machines, structures, and physical failure cascades.
2. **Field Fix Instinct** — rapid improvisational repair under pressure.
3. **Bullshit Detection / Candor** — cuts through bad assumptions fast; hard to politically manipulate.
4. **Physical Dominance** — reliable close-range force and intimidation presence.

- Uses dark humor as pressure valve.
- Values competence and honesty over politeness.
- Calls people out without reserve when he senses self-deception or institutional nonsense.

---

## Open Placeholders (TBD)
- Exact rank/specialty designation in squad structure.
- Specific combat loadout and technical kit.
- Core weakness stack (to be developed with crew interaction model).
- Key emotional contradiction and long-arc growth target.
- Relationship map with Hale, Veil, and remaining two team members.

## Working Character Thesis
Marko Branik is the team’s blunt-force mechanic-oracle: a giant who breaks through people and problems head-on, yet sees mechanical truth with rare clarity and fights to keep his mind unowned.
