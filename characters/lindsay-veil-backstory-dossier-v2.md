# Lindsay "Lin" Veil — Backstory Dossier v2 (Causality-First)

## Current Function on Team
Sensor/astrogation early-warning specialist. Lin detects pattern drift before it becomes casualties and pairs with Hale as see-first/act-fast doctrine.

## Formative Incident Chain (Timeline-Linked)
1. **Childhood in conflict-dense domestic environment (pre-EDF)**  
   - Learns to predict mood shifts to avoid harm.
2. **Veil Family Mediation Burden Years (0097)**  
   - Becomes emotional stabilizer for adults; develops harmony addiction and self-erasure habits.
3. **Technical education channel into navigation/sensor mathematics**  
   - Pattern-reading talent receives formal frame, reinforcing identity as anticipator.
4. **Squad attrition exposure (0150)**  
   - Repeated loss binds her intuition to survivor guilt: “if I miss one signal, someone dies.”
5. **Escape betrayal sequence (0170)**  
   - Confirms that social reads and movement reads both matter under command deceit.

## Belief Formation (Cause → Belief)
- Early home volatility → **“Conflict ignored becomes danger.”**
- Forced peacemaker role → **“My value is keeping everyone regulated.”**
- Sensor success under pressure → **“Patterns speak before people do.”**
- Attrition + betrayal → **“Silence for harmony can become complicity with disaster.”**

## Coping Mechanics
- **Primary:** Over-prepare route trees and confidence bands.
- **Secondary:** Soft language to reduce escalation between teammates.
- **Stress tell:** Self-silencing when disagreements sharpen.
- **Maladaptive edge:** Delays hard truths to preserve group cohesion, increasing later blast radius.

## Arc Pressure Points
- **B1 pressure:** Saves team with anomaly detection but internalizes responsibility for everyone’s emotional state.
- **B2 midpoint pressure:** Harmony delay error contributes to near-ambush (scaffold lock).
- **B2 climax pressure:** Boundary assertion becomes tactical act, not interpersonal preference.

## Team Thematic Identity Contribution
Lin embodies the theme that care and precision must coexist: empathy without boundaries is exploitable, but empathy with boundaries becomes strategic strength.

## Continuity Hooks to Use in Scenes
- She spots tiny vector mismatches others dismiss.
- Uses low-friction language until mission risk crosses threshold, then goes sharp/direct.
- Her best calls happen when she stops managing everyone’s feelings.
