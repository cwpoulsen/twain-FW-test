# Private Lindsay "Lin" Veil — Character Bible v2 (Specificity Pass)

## Snapshot
- **Name:** Private Lindsay "Lin" Veil
- **Role:** Sensors + astrogation lead; anomaly detection and escape-vector design
- **Core Hook:** She sees pattern break before anyone else and pays for that gift by feeling everyone’s fear as if it were hers.
- **Status:** Canon-aligned working anchor

---

## Operational Identity

### Functional Role on Blackfly
- Owns passive/active sensor fusion during approach, burn, and disengagement windows.
- Builds rapid “threat-shape” reads from tiny inconsistencies (thermal bloom delay, transponder cadence mismatch, impossible stationkeeping drift).
- Produces maneuver recommendations in time bands (15 sec / 90 sec / 5 min decision horizons).

### Hale/Veil Combat Pairing
- **Veil predicts shape and timing of danger.**
- **Hale commits force and command intent.**
- Pair works when Hale treats her calls as early-warning data, not anxiety.

## Psychological Profile

### Strengths
1. **Pattern foresight under uncertainty** — detects hostile intent before full confirmation.
2. **Protective cognition** — naturally tracks who is most exposed in every maneuver.
3. **Anti-groupthink pressure** — flags comforting narratives that contradict telemetry.
4. **Dual-register communication** — can switch from empathic crew language to hard tactical brevity instantly.

### Weaknesses / Failure Modes
1. **Emotional overcoupling** — absorbs team tension and loses cognitive bandwidth.
2. **Harmony reflex** — delays hard dissent to keep cohesion.
3. **False responsibility load** — self-blames for outcomes outside her control.
4. **Strife bleed-through** — prolonged internal conflict reduces confidence in her own correct reads.

## Voice Anchors
- Private voice: lyrical/metaphoric when safe, often framing trajectories as weather or current.
- Tactical voice: clipped and numerical (“contact delta +12 sec, port burn now, no debate”).
- Under stress: asks one clarifying question, then gives a direct recommendation.

---

## Scene-Usable Behavioral Fingerprints
- Marks three exit options on every map even when mission doctrine assumes one route.
- Calls out “comfort assumptions” in planning briefs.
- During conflict, physically positions herself between most volatile teammates.
- When overwhelmed, focuses on instrument cadence counting to recover decision clarity.

---

## Arc Spine (Books 1–4)
- **B1:** Establishes credibility through accurate threat reads that avert losses.
- **B2:** Internalizes crew fractures and hesitates once at a critical branch, producing real cost.
- **B3:** Learns boundary discipline: care without carrying everyone.
- **B4:** Uses empathy as command asset—names emotional state and tactical consequence in same breath.

---

## Constraints + Continuity Notes
- Do not turn intuition into mysticism; every correct call must map to observable pattern inputs.
- Keep her fearlessness physical and her vulnerability relational.
- Preserve no-FTL burn/comms limits: her solutions are geometry, timing, and discipline—not miracle sensing.

## Working Character Thesis
Lin Veil is the unit’s living early-warning radar: she protects people by seeing the fracture line first, then learning that protection requires boundaries as much as bravery.
