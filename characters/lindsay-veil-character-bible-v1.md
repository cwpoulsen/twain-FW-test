# Private Lindsay "Lin" Veil — Character Bible v1 (Working)

## Snapshot
- **Name:** Private Lindsay "Lin" Veil
- **Role:** Sensor/astrogation specialist; threat-intuition partner to John Hale
- **Core Hook:** A dreamy shield-maiden mind inside a hard warfighter body—she reads danger before others and helps the team find exits under pressure.
- **Status:** **In progress** (intentional placeholders retained)

---

## Current Crew Function (Locked)

### Operational Role
- Shipboard **sensors lead** as soon as team transitions to free operations.
- High-end mathematical processing + astrogation competence.
- Reads enemy intent from movement/positioning patterns.
- Calls out anomalies, subtle mismatches, and likely failure modes others miss.
- Strong anti-groupthink asset in planning and execution.

### Hale/Vale Tactical Pairing
- **Vale sees it early.**
- **Hale turns it into action.**
- She identifies exits and threat trajectories; he converts those reads into maneuvers/orders.

### Combat Posture
- Fearless in contact.
- Willingly places herself in danger to protect teammates.
- Shield-maiden framing is active concept (literal shield implementation TBD).

## Psychological Profile (Locked for now)

### Strengths
1. **Pattern Intuition Under Fire** — strong rapid synthesis of motion, context, and intent.
2. **Protective Instinct** — naturally team-preserving orientation.
3. **Independent Judgment** — resistant to consensus drift/groupthink.
4. **Thinker + Dreamer Duality** — strategic imagination plus technical precision.

### Weaknesses / Failure Modes (Current Best Set)
1. **Emotional Overcoupling** — absorbs crew emotional states; weak self/other boundary under stress.
2. **Compulsive Harmony-Seeking** — extreme people-pleasing can suppress timely hard truths.
3. **Misplaced Emotional Accountability** — carries guilt/conflict that does not belong to her.
4. **Strife-Induced Drift** — prolonged crew tension degrades focus/mood/decision confidence.

## Dialogue / Social Register
- Early book: formal military address conventions dominate (e.g., **Private Veil**).
- As crew bond deepens, decorum and military terminology should gradually soften.
- Lin’s voice should carry contrast: soft imaginative language in private moments, sharp technical clarity in tactical moments.

## Character Design Placeholders (Intentional)

### Backstory (TBD)
- **Constraint:** backstory must support established crew role and weakness profile, not replace or override them.
- Placeholder questions:
  - What made her so good at pattern detection and astrogation?
  - Where did hyper-empathy/people-pleasing survival behavior originate?
  - What prior relationship model shaped her shield/protector identity?

### Literal Shield Concept (TBD)
- Decide whether she carries:
  - [ ] ballistic breacher shield
  - [ ] modular deployable cover system
  - [ ] symbolic/nonliteral “shield” only
- If literal, define realistic tactical constraints and tradeoffs.

### Crew-Drama Function (TBD refinement)
- Current direction: internal strife affects her disproportionately, creating both warning sensitivity and emotional fragility.
- Need final mechanism for how this drives turning points (planning conflict, mission outcomes, relationship beats).

### Arc Spine (Book 1+) (TBD)
- Draft goal: integrate compassion + boundaries without flattening empathy.
- Need explicit phase beats and decision tests.

## Working Character Thesis
Private Lindsay "Lin" Veil is the team’s early-warning conscience and tactical sensor mind: she can see danger and exits before anyone else, but her extreme empathy and need to hold everyone together can turn crew conflict into her own battlefield.
